<br /><h2>Directors of ISOC-AU</h2>

<br clear="all"><br /><br />
<img src="../npics/liner.gif" alt="line" height="2" width="100%">

<br />
<br />
The Constitution allows for three to twelve Directors, elected for
three-year terms.  One-third of the Board must retire every year, with
new elections held at the AGM (usually in November or December).  Any
current ISOC-AU member is welcome to stand or be nominated for election
to the Board.  A candidate for election must be proposed and seconded
by current members.

<br /><br />
The Directors convene every month by teleconference and also try to
meet at least twice a year in person.  Minutes of the meetings are
posted on the ISOC-AU website regularly.  The Directors act in a
volunteer capacity; they appoint an Executive Director 
for administration and organisation of Society activities.  <br /><br />

The officers of the Society are the President, Vice-President,
Honorary Treasurer and Honorary Secretary.  The Vice-President chairs
meetings when the President is unable to attend.  The Honorary
Treasurer administers the finances, keeps records of accounts, and
submits the financial statements to the auditor before the Annual
General Meeting.  The Honorary Secretary is responsible for the
Minutes, correspondence, and the convening of official meetings.

<h3>Ms Gunela Astbrink</h3></a>

 BA (James Cook), Grad DipLib (UNSW), AALIA, FRSA
<br /><br />

After having started using the Internet in the early '90s and
generally "preaching" its potential, I started focusing on a key
policy areas.

<br /><br />

That is to ensure that the Internet is available to everyone. Using
inclusive design principles when developing Internet applications
including web sites makes it easier for older people, people with
disabilities and people in rural areas to better share information and
communicate online. I have written articles and given presentations
and demonstrations on accessibility since 1996.

<br /><br />

Working with the Telematics and Disability Centre at Swedish Telecom
in the early '90s gave me an international focus on both R&amp;D and
service delivery. I was also Chair of the Information Transfer Working
Group of COST 219, a European Commission Action Project on
telecommunications and disability and was the Australian member of
COST 219 for twelve years.

<br /><br />

I was National Coordinator of TEDICORE (Telecommunications and
Disability Consumer Representation) for over ten years until it merged
into the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN) in
2009. During that time, I had ongoing input to government and industry
reviews, inquiries, participated in codes and standards development
and initiated a wide variety of issues with key stakeholders.

<br /><br />

I also led a research project at the Smart Internet Technologies
Cooperative Research Centre on multi-modal mobile devices and was part
of the user-centred design team.

<br /><br />

Another way of working towards reducing the "digital divide" in the
community has been through an ISOC Community Grant leading
capacity-building workshops at PacINET and the IGF in 2009. I am
continuing my involvement at PacINET with further workshops.

<br /><br />

Currently, my company GSA Information Consultants does a variety of
European Commission projects on e-accessibility and innovation policy
as well as Australian projects using Internet tools to improve the
lives of people with disabilities.

hspace="10">
<h3>Dr Paul Brooks</h3></a>

BSc (Hons) in Physics and Computer Science (University of Adelaide), Ph.D. in
Astrophysics (University of New South Wales)

<br /><br />

I lead <a href="http://www.layer10.com.au">Layer10 Advisory</a>, an independent
consultancy practice specialising in telecommunications network architecture,
broadband access and service provider network operations. Sometimes described as
a "Serial CTO", my expertise in telecommunications network design,
planning and operation is derived from extensive hands-on experience
in broadband access and large-scale data networking. I have a
practical and pragmatic knowledge of communications protocols, leading
equipment suppliers, carriers and service providers, and the
Australian regulatory environment, which has been formed through
consulting projects and executive positions in carriers large and
small.
<br /><br />

I have served as CTO/Engineering Director and/or Board member for a
number of carriers and start-up service providers, including Global
One, Flowcom/Macrocom, eCOM and Vocus, and I have direct experience in
Australian FTTN networking and broadband video delivery, through my
time as CTO at TransACT Communications in Canberra. As a consultant I
have provided technical expert advice to regulators including ACCC and
NZ Commerce Commission on DSL, ULL and copper interference issues,
designed and deployed optical fibre terrestrial networks and a
submarine cable system, and advised numerous ISPs on broadband access
design and operation.

<br /><br />

I am an active participant within the Australian ISP community and a
co-founder of Vocus Communications, ATUG and Communications Alliance,
where I am currently leading the NBN Project. I am a Foundation Member
of ISOC-AU.

<br /><br />

I believe the Internet and broadband access can continue to improve
and transform Australian and global society. While huge gains have
been achieved, much more needs to be done to improve access for those
that cannot currently connect to the Internet through broadband
networks, and the network services and infrastructure currently in use
must be improved to provide more symmetric access and more reliable
and predictable performance. Broadband networks and the Internet can
grow from being primarily a conduit for entertainment and non-critical
communications to a fundamental enabler of productive contribution and
a reliable support for critical communications. ISOC-AU and the
Internet Society, organisations stradding the policy and technical
realms, are key to guiding this process.

<h3>Ms Narelle Clark</h3></a>
BAppSc, MEng, PGDipMgt, MIEEE, MComsoc
<br />
<br />

I am a data communications and Internet specialist who has been working
in advanced technology areas consistently throughout my career.
Specialising in the application of networks and systems, I have a broad
technical view of Internet scale ICT delivery. I have been a user,
builder, operator and researcher of Internet networks since 1986, both
for major telcos and research agencies, and have a particular interest
in convergent networks and applications.

<br /><br /> 

Now employed as Deputy CEO of <a href="http://www.accan.org.au"
target="_blank">ACCAN</a>, the peak advocacy body for consumers in the
Australian communications market place, I have worked in many communications
areas, from running my own telecoms and Internet consultancy (<a
href="http://www.pavonis.com.au">Pavonis Consulting</a>) to, in previous
years, being directly employed by CSIRO, Optus, SingTel, Vodafone and
universities, in roles from network architecture and operations to the
introduction of emerging technology. Back in the early days of the
Australian Internet I was responsible for development and operation of
campus networks and research labs doing medical and Internet software
projects. I have a Bachelor of Applied Science and a Masters in Engineering,
the latter majoring in information systems and telecommunications, as well
as a postgraduate diploma in Management. I also hold a seat on the Board of
Trustees of the global Internet Society.

hspace="10">
<h3>Mr Roger Clarke</h3></a>
BComm(Hons I), MComm UNSW, PhD ANU, FACS
<br />
<br />

   I've been active in the IT industry since 1970, since 1982 through my
own company, Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd.  My consultancy CV is at
http://www.xamax.com.au/Principal.html.  For the last 20 years, I've
focussed on strategic and policy aspects of eBusiness, information
infrastucture, and dataveillance and privacy.  I spent 1984-95 as a senior
information systems academic, and have continued my research and
supervision activities as a Visiting Professor at ANU (in computer science)
and UNSW (in cyberspace law and policy).  The resources on my web-site have
accumulated over 30 million hits since early 1995, and are running at 4
million hits p.a.: <a href="http://www.rogerclarke.com"
target="_blank">www.rogerclarke.com</a>.

<br /><br />

   My involvement in Internet matters dates to the early 1990s, in the form
of analyses of the economics of AARNet, regulation of bulletin board
systems, electronic tools to support academics, and human behaviour in
cyberspace.  From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, I performed consultancy,
undertook research, and provided expert evidence on such matters as Web
commerce, cookies, spam, identity, nymity, authentication, digital
signatures and PKI, regulation of on-line gambling, the investigation of
criminal acts and of inappropriate behaviour, defamation on the Web, and
open source, open content and open access. For 6 years, I chaired a company
in the 'dot.gov' space that encouraged liberal copyright licensing (before
Creative Commons was invented).  In 1998-2004, I wrote what even now
appears to be one of the very few histories of the Internet in Australia.

<br /><br />

   More recently I've worked on P2P, Web 2.0, carbon eTrading, deep packet
inspection, mobile payments security, malware, user organisation
requirements for cloud computing, and the very different net behaviours of
Gen-Yers and iGens.  Relevant papers are indexed at
http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/ and
http://www.rogerclarke.com/WhatsNew.html#II.

<br /><br />

   In addition to 8 years as a Director and Chair of two corporations, I've
served on a range of pro bono Boards.  Of relevance to ISOC-AU, I've been
on the Board of the Australian Privacy Foundation (APF) since its formation
in 1987, and am its Chair 2006-2010, and I was on the Board of Electronic
Frontiers Australia (EFA) 2001-05.  I greatly respect ISOC-AU's capacity to
contribute to policy formation in the information infrastructure area.  I
anticipate bringing my background and energy to bear, particularly in the
consumer rights and privacy areas.

<h3>Mr George Fong</h3></a>
BA (Hons) Law (CNAA); Barrister-at-Law Lincoln's Inn; Advocate and
   Solicitor, Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore.
<br /><br />

 I have been involved in the Internet in many different dimensions since
the mid 1980s. My involvement started in the academic world, evolved into
the development of a regional Internet Service Provider and has seen me
involved since then in many community, strategic and commercial projects
concentrating on regional and rural Australia. 

<br /><br />
Through my company
Lateral Plains, we have been able to tackle the unfinished
business of working for parity and equity of access for the full spectrum
of the regional and rural demographic. In my previous stint as a director
of ISOC-AU this was an important focus. As I rejoin the board I am
motivated and inspired by what this organisation can continue to do to
ensure that the Internet truly is for everyone.

I became a director of ISOC-AU in November 2008 and am looking forward to
building on the great work of other current and past directors to provide
broad-based representation of the Australian internet community and promoting
the availability of the internet for all Australians.

<h3>Ms Cheryl Langdon-Orr</h3></a>
Twenty plus years ago I left my Post-Grad research and career as a tutor in
Physiology (although I am still a Teaching Associate at the Asia Pacific   
Research Institute of Macquarie University) to operate our then micro      
enterprise, Hovtek Pty. Limited.

<br /><br />
I am a telecommuter, and licensee of domain names in .au as well as in the
global DNS, but most importantly, I am an avid end-user of the Internet for
work and recreation. Recently we have established a second business
interest, which was developed form some of the TQM activities of Hovtek;
BuildersNet, which relies totally on the Internet to facilitate its
operation.

<br /><br />
Our clients in Australia are Micro Businesses and SMEs - and internationally
mainly SMEs and Government or Aid Funded bodies; we service and communicate 
with them almost exclusively online and the majority of our importation of  
raw materials and products as well as export documentation bookings etc. is 
now handled that way. I am a Director in several Associations and a NFP   
company interested in Global Trade and SME growth, facilitated by Internet  
use, under the auspices of UNCTAD.

<br /><br />
I believe the Internet should be seen as a public
asset and needs to be developed and maintained as a cost-effective and 
accessible resource for communication, education, community, social and
business opportunities by the Australian and wider global community.

<br /><br />
My focus and ongoing interests are not specifically technical but rather
more consumer and end user focused (I currently represent ISOC-AU in the
ACIF Consumer Advisory Council) with a keen interest in Policy Development,
Access, Outreach and Regulatory issues.

<br /><br />
I was an Individual Member (prior to the formation of our Chapter) of ISOC
and am a Demand Class Member of auDA, having been recently re-elected as a
Board Member for my second term of office. Previously I have worked on several
auDA Policy Advisory Panels, and am the current Chair of the Domain Name  
Industry Code of Practice Committee.

<h3>Mr Andrew McRae</h3></a>
I am a founding member of ISOC-AU, and have been involved with
networking and the Internet for as long as it has been available in
Australia, even back to the ACSnet days. 

<br /><br />
I am a senior software
engineer with Google, based in the Sydney Engineering office. Prior to
Google, I was a Principal Engineer with a silicon valley startup
working on networking products, and before that, I was a
Distinguished Engineer at Cisco Systems.

<br /><br />
I would like to see ISOC-AU play a vital role in ensuring
that the Internet in Australia grows and develops in an open
and vital way, so that Australian individuals and businesses
benefit from the enabling technologies of the Internet.

<h3>Mr Craig O'Toole</h3></a>
BE (Hons)<br /><br />

I am a technology leader and visionary, pushing the limits of the
technology available (and sometimes newly created) to provide the best
outcomes for clients and the community. With a focus on computing and
engineering in my studies and from a very young age, it wouldn't have been
difficult to guess this would lead me to a passion for information
technology, I am one of the few to stick with my interests and make my
career more than just a day job. 

<br /><br />

As a director/owner of <a href="http://www.remex.com.au/"
target="_blank">Remex Consulting Pty Limited</a>, an IT&amp;T consulting
business, and a director/owner of EXL Pty Limited, a specialist SME ISP, I
bring a strong experience in, and passion about, values-based business
practices and care deeply about the future. This is tempered with the
realities of contributing to a viable  business practice.

<br /><br />

I have a passion to create a focus for everyone to be involved and actively
improve the Internet. With the ever increasing ubiquity to everyone on the
planet, it is crucial that we all see the importance of advancing the
Internet. I am excited to live in a time where so many new uses are being
found for telecommunications and computing.

<h3>Mr Skeeve Stevens</h3></a>

   I've been involved with the Internet since the days it was turned on
while I was at University in 1990. Watching the Internet grow over the
past 20 years has been an amazing experience - both personally and
professionally.

<br /> <br />

   My involvement in the Internet in the early years related to computer
security - aka, Hacking.  Hacking was something that taught me a lot about
interconnected-networks, how they were put together, and most importantly
how they could be abused.  This unfortunately resulted in being on the
wrong side of the law a few times in the late 1990's.

<br /> <br />

   This experience strengthened my resolve to use my skills for good and
become involved in 'how' the Internet runs - and more importantly, how it
could be run more effectively.  I became involved in the operational side
of ISP networks, working my way up from Helpdesk to designing and building
one of the first multi-carrier aggregator Service Providers in the
country.

<br /> <br />

   Being involved with over 150 ISPs to date, I am now the CEO and owner
of eintellego, a network integrator that specialises in designing,
building and managing the day-to-day operations of ISPs and enterprises.
Today we manage many ISPs and high profile enterprise networks. eintellego
are also one of the leading independent consultancies on IPv6 networking
integration in the Asia Pacific region, with consulting activities in over
10 countries.

<br /> <br />

   Over the last 10 years I have become involved in Internet Governance
via APNIC (a Regional Internet Registry), attending conferences,
presenting policies and debating many others.  I also have a passion for
helping developing nations with developing infrastructure to move forward
and participate in the global community.

<br /> <br />

   I've been involved also with ISOC-AU over the past couple of years and
see ISOC-AU as a powerful forum for Internet related issues, consulting
and influencing government policy, as well as lobbying for the rights of
Internet users - both end-user and businesses alike.  I believe ISOC-AU is
a great model for the development of Internet Society chapters in
developing nations.
