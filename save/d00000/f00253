<p><a href="http://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon</a> is approaching, and
 all MirBSD developers will attend… but why’s there no MirBSD exhibit?
 The answer to that is a bit complex. First let’s state that of course
 we will participate in the event as well as the Open Source world.
 We’ll also be <a href="permalinks/wlog-10_e20130608-tg.htm"
 title="Waypoint Statistics">geocaching</a> around the campus with other
 interested (mostly OSS) people (including those we won for this sport)
 and helping out other OSS projects we’ve become attached to.</p>
<p>MirOS BSD, the operating system, is a niche system. The conference
 on the other hand got “younger” and more mainstream. This means that
 almost all conference visitors do not belong to the target group of
 MirOS BSD which somewhat is an “ancient solution”: the most classical
 BSD around (NetBSD® loses because they have rc.d and PAM and lack
 <a href="htman/i386/man8/sendmail.htm" class="manlink">sendmail(8)</a>, sorry guys, your attempt at being not reformable doesn’t
 count) and running on restricted hardware (such as my 486SLC with 12
 MiB RAM) and exots (SPARCstation). It’s viable even as developer
 workstation (if your hardware is supported… otherwise just virtualise
 it) but its strength lies with SPARC support and “embedded x86”. And
 being run as virtual machine: we’re reportedly more stable and more
 performant than OpenBSD. MirBSD is not cut off from modern development
 and occasionally takes a questionable but justified choice (such as
 using 16-bit Unicode internally) or a weird-looking but beneficial
 one (such as OPTU encoding saving us <a href="htman/i386/man1/locale.htm" class="manlink">locale(1)</a> hassles) or even acts
 as technological pioneer (64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> on ILP32 platforms)
 or, at least, is faster than OpenBSD (newer GNU toolchain, things
 like that), but usually more conservatively, and yes, this is by
 design, not by lack of manpower, most of the time.</p>
<p>The MirPorts Framework, while technically superiour in enough
 places, is something that just cannot happen without manpower.
 I (tg@) am still using it exclusively, continuing to update ports
 I use and occasionally creating new ones (mupdf is in the works!),
 but it’s not something I’d recommend someone (other than an Mac OSX
 user) to use on a nōn-MirBSD system (Interix is not exactly thriving
 either, and the Interix support was only begun; other OSes are not
 widely tested).</p>
<p><a href="mksh.htm">The MirBSD Korn Shell</a> is probably
 the one thing I will be remembered for. But I have absolutely no idea
 how one would present it on a booth at such an exhibition. A talk is
 much more likely. So no on that front too.</p>
<p><a href="jupp.htm">jupp, the editor which sucks less</a>,
 is probably something that does deserve mainstream interest (especially
 considering Natureshadow is using it while teaching computing to kids)
 but probably more in a workshop setting. And booth space is precious
 enough in the FH so I think that’d be unfair.</p>
<p>All the other subprojects and side projects Benny and I have, such
 as <a href="https://freewrt.org/projects/mirmince/">mirₘᵢₙcⒺ</a>,
 josef stalin, FreeWRT, Lunix Ewe, Shellsnippets, the fonts, etc. are
 interesting but share few, if any, common ground. Again, this does not
 match the vast majority of visitors. While we probably should push a
 number of these more, but a booth isn’t “it” here, either.</p>
<p>MirOS Linux (“MirLinux”) and MirOS Windows are, despite otherwise-saying
 rumours called W*k*p*d*a, only premature ideas that will not really be
 worked on (though MirLinux concepts are found in mirₘᵢₙcⒺ and stalin).</p>
<p>As you can see, despite all developers having full-time dayjobs,
 The MirOS Project is far from being obsolete. We hope that our website
 visitors understand our reasons to not have an exhibition booth of our
 own (even if the SPARCstation makes for a way cool one, it’s too heavy
 to lift all the time), and would like to point out that there are several
 other booths (commercial ones, as well as OSS ones such as AllBSD, Debian
 and (talking to) others) and other itineries we participate in. This year
 both Benny and I have been roped into helping out the conference itself,
 too (not exactly unvoluntarily though).</p>
<p>The best way to talk to us is <a href="irc.htm">IRC</a>
 during regular European “geek” hours (i.e. until way too late into the
 night – which Americans should benefit from), semi-synchronously, or <a
 href="rss.htm#lists">mailing lists</a>. We sort of expect you
 to not be afraid to <a href="man.htm">RTFM</a> and <a
 href="wtf.htm">look up acronyms</a> you don’t understand;
 The MirOS Project is not unfriendly but definitely not suited for your
 proverbial Aunt Tilly, newbies, “desktop” users, and people who aren’t
 at least somewhat capable of using written English (this is by design).</p>

<p>Just a few words on it (more in the README.1st file included): this is
 a port of <a href="mksh.htm">The MirBSD Korn Shell</a> R39 to
 the native WinAPI; it’s not quite got the full Unix feel (especially as
 it targets the Weihenstephan unxutils instead of a full Interix or Cygwin
 environment) but doesn’t need a full POSIX emulation layer either. It’s
 intended to replace MKS ksh and the MKS Toolkit. Source for the compatibility
 library is also included under <a href="MirOS-Licence.htm">The
 MirOS Licence</a>; we aim at publishing it as OSI Certified Open Source
 Software like mksh itself. (There is a situation with dlmalloc/nedmalloc
 being resolved, and the icon is derived from the BSD dæmon which is a
 protected unregistered trademark, but we’re not Mozilla and allow distro
 packages to keep using it ☺) Rebasing it on a newer <a href="htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm" class="manlink">mksh(1)</a> followed by
 (partial) integration into the main source code is a goal.</p>
<p>Have fun trying it out and hacking on it. It’s currently built with
 <tt>-DMKSH_NOPROSPECTOFWORK</tt> (so coprocesses and a few other minor
 things won’t work), but a <tt>SIGCHLD</tt> emulation is being worked
 on – but if you want to help out, I’m sure it’s welcome, just come on
 <a href="irc.htm">IRC</a> or post on the mailing list, and
 I’ll forward things to Michael as needed. Reports on testing with other
 toolchain and OS versions are also welcome.</p>

<p>Just in case someone wonders… I haven’t found any time and “head
 capacity” to hack recently; $dayjob leaving me sucked dry, with the
 weather also playing in, etc. but neither did I disappear nor do I
 intend to drop anything planned.</p>
<p>Sorry for keeping even medium and more severe bugs open for such
 a long time (several weeks by now, for some); recently I was assured
 my response time – especially for an Open Source volunteer – is very
 <em>good</em> still, even if I find it lacking sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="mksh.htm">mksh</a>, as one specific thing to
 mention here, will get an R47 release RSN™ (i.e. as soon as I get
 around to do it) which could be labelled R46b too (except I like
 integer version numbers more), it <em>will</em> (that’s a promise)
 be bugfix-only and <em>ought to</em> be dropped into any place
 that’s currently shipping R45 or R46, at the very least (and maybe
 R44 too, and no older versions should be around at all anyway).</p>
<p>Note that me beginning to catch up the TODO list, like today’s
 <a href="htman/i386/man1/cvs.htm" class="manlink">cvs(1)</a> upload to Debian, shall not be taken as a sign of me being
 back (just that I found myself to tackle something). It did take
 way too long, it’s 22:15 localtime already again, and I had planned
 to catch up on my leisure reading a bit this evening (damn…) but,
 well. At least I managed to put in some outdoor fun (to be exact, <a
 href="permalinks/wlog-10_e20130608-tg.htm">visiting some
 more waypoints</a>) too (though I expect this weekend to be scary
 <em>and</em> it’s definitely <em>under</em>planned ☹ – but who knows,
 maybe it’ll be great fun, and wbx@ and my biggest little brother are

<p>I’ve finally gotten around to listing all Waypoints (Geocaches,
 Opencaches, Closedcaches, Earthcaches, Terracaches including
 Locationless, Navicaches, etc.) I’ve found a box, enjoyful,
 educating, a good place to hide one myself, etc. and putting up
 a <a href="WPtg.htm">list</a> and, of course, generate
 my own statpic.</p>
<p class="cr">I’ll put them up for the other project members, too
 (already made a picture for gecko2@ but bsiegert@ still needs one;
 we also need to collect offline lists of found, owned and attended
 waypoints)…</p>
<p>A bit of background story: I decided, years ago, to have an offline
 list of cache finds in case something would happen. Just, I had found
 way too many already, so this was a huge bit of work. Oh well… I of
 course procrastinated, and then something did happen (Opencaching
 wanting to force a <a href="http://freeculture.org/blog/2012/08/27/stop-the-inclusion-of-proprietary-licenses-in-creative-commons-4-0/">Restricted
 Commons</a> licence; me disagreeing and suggesting a change; some
 trigger-happy person immediately deleting my account without waiting
 for the discussion <em>or</em> the decision period to end; weeks of
 forum discussions; Opencaching allowing dual-licencing; them telling
 me they can’t restore my data – probably never heard of databa…sorry,
 MySQL backups). And I still didn’t have the list. Now I do; recreated
 even the OC information from what was still accessible and with help
 from one OC supporter (“<tt>mic@</tt>”, thanks); merged caches that
 are co-listed on several platforms, etc. (still need to put in the
 FTF/STF/TTF/4TF/LTF and voting/favourites information) and a statpic,
 all in Open Source and Open Data, in <a href="htman/i386/man1/cvs.htm" class="manlink">cvs(1)</a> with <a href="htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm" class="manlink">mksh(1)</a> and… a…
 frontend for libgd2 I admit, but we had been using that for the
 MirWebsite for a while already.</p>
<p>I suggest every geocacher keep an offline or local record of all
 their finds (and hides and attended logs) for things like this, in
 case some platform decides to… let’s say, “put your data into the
 cloud… where it is? I don’t know”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.die-welt.net/2013/05/powerdyn-a-dynamic-dns-service-for-powerdns-users/">Apparently
 (hi Zhenech, found on Plänet Debian)</a>, a Man does not only need
 to fork a child, plant a tree, etc. in their life but also write a
 DynDNS service. Perfect for opening a new tag in the wlog called
 archæology (<a href="http://www.pagetable.com/">pagetable.com –
 Some Assembly Required</a> is also a nice example for these).</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I used SixXS’ heartbeat protocol client for
 updating the Legacy IP (known as “IPv4” earlier) endpoint address
 of my tunnel at home (<a href="http://www.netcologne.de/">My ISP</a>
 offers static v4 for some payment now, luckily). Their client sucked,
 so I wrote on in <a href="mksh.htm">ksh</a>, naturally.</p>
<p>And because <a href="htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm" class="manlink">mksh(1)</a> is such nice a language to program in (although,
 I only really begun becoming proficient in Korn Shell in 2005-2006 or
 so, thus please take those scripts with a grain of salt, I’d do them
 <em>much</em> differently nowadays) I also wrote a heartbeat server
 implementation. In Shell.</p>
<p>The heartbeat server supports different backends (per client), and
 to date I’ve run backends providing DynDNS (automatically disabling
 the RR if the client goes offline), an IP (IPv6) tunnel of my own
 (basically the same setup SixXS has, without knowing theirs), <a href="htman/i386/man8/rdate.htm" class="manlink">rdate(8)</a>
 based time offset monitoring for <a href="htman/i386/man8/ntpd.htm" class="manlink">ntpd(8)</a>, and an eMail forwarding
 service (as one <strong>must not run an MTA on dynamic IP</strong>)
 with it; some of these even in parallel.</p>
<p>Not all of it is documented, but I’ve written up most things in <a
 href="cvs.cgi/contrib/code/heartbeat/">CVS</a>. There also
 were some issues (mostly to do with killing <a href="htman/i386/man1/sleep.htm" class="manlink">sleep(1)</a>ing subprocesses
 not working right), so it occasionally hung, but very rarely. Running
 it under the supervise of DJB dæmontools was nice, as I was already
 using djbdns, since I do not understand the BIND zone file format and
 do not consider MySQL a database (and did not even like databases at
 all, back then). For DynDNS, the heartbeat server’s backend simply
 updated the zone file (by either adding or updating or deleting the
 line for the client) then running tinydns-data, then rsync’ing it
 to the djbdns server primary and secondaries, then running zonenotify
 so the BIND secondaries get a NOTIFY to update their zones (so I never
 had to bother much with the SOA values, only allow AXFR). That’s a
 really <a href="wtf.cgi?kiss">KISS</a> setup ☺</p>
<p>Anyway. This is archæology. The scripts are there, feel free to
 use them, hack on them, take them as examples… even submit back
 patches if you want. I’ll even answer questions, to some degree,
 in <a href="irc.htm">IRC</a>. But that’s it. I urge
 people to go use a decent ISP, even if the bandwidth is smaller.
 To paraphrase a coworker after he cancelled his cable based internet
 access (I think at Un*tym*dia) before the 2-week trial period was
 even over: rather have slow but reliable internet at Netc*logne
 than “that”. People, vote with your purse!</p>

<p>The <a href="mksh.htm">MirBSD Korn Shell</a> R45 has been
 released today, and R44 has been named the new stable/bugfix-only series.
 (That’s version 45.1, not 0.45, dear Homebrew/MacOSX packagers.)</p>
<p>Packagers rejoice: the <tt>-DMKSH_GCC55009</tt> dance is no longer needed,
 and even the run-time check for integer division is gone. Why? Because I
 realised one cannot use signed integers in C, at all, and rewrote the <a href="htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm" class="manlink">mksh(1)</a>
 arithmetics code to use unsigned integers only. Special thanks to the people
 from <a href="http://www.musl-libc.org/">musl libc</a> and, to some lesser
 amount, Natureshadow for providing me with ideas what algorithms to replace
 some functionality with (signed shell arithmetic is, of course, still usable,
 it is just emulated using unsigned C integers now).</p>

<p>On Saturday March 23, this year's pkgsrc conference (pkgsrccon 2013)
 took place in Berlin. Julian Fagir organized it with unending energy,
 even though pkgsrc is not the primary focus of his NetBSD work. He just
 took matters in his hands because no one else stepped forward. A big
 thanks for that!</p>

<p>The flight from Zurich to Berlin was uneventful. It was my first
 flight to TXL airport (I normally arrive at SXF), and arriving there is
 incredibly quick and convenient compared to the latter. The terminal is
 very small, and it takes just five minutes to go from the plane to a
 bus to the city.</p>

<p>Now for the conference itself: we started at 12pm on Saturday with a
 program of talks but no fixed schedule. Due to this, the conference
 took a long time (we finished only at 9pm or so) but on the other hand,
 it allowed for lots of interesting and fruitful discussion. At no point
 did we have to cut a question short because of a lack of time. Overall,
 I think that this was an excellent choice and made the conference more
 useful and productive.</p>

<p>We were about 21 people &ndash; mostly pkgsrc developers (of course)
 but also a Debian Developer (Ralf Treinen, who presented his work on
 Mancoosi), a FreeBSD dev and some interested users. I won't give an
 exhaustive recollection of all talks here but simply comment on a few
 ones that I found particularly interesting.</p>

<p>The most important theme of the conference was virtualization and
 cloud computing. Jonathan Perkin and Filip Hajny gave a talk about
 their company's product, SmartOS, and how it uses pkgsrc. SmartOS is a
 "cloud OS" based on OpenSolaris. It boots from a read-only medium (such
 as a CD) into a lean system that only does the administration of all
 the zones that it runs. All useful work happens in zones, which are a
 sort of lightweight VM solution specific to OpenSolaris. The zone
 images include access to a very complete set of pkgsrc packages for
 things such as a compiler. They can also run other OSes (NetBSD!) by
 setting up a zone that runs KVM. Joyent runs a large public cloud with
 SmartOS, where customers purchase virtual machines by the hour. This is
 similar to Amazon EC2 but with a focus on high performance.</p>

<p>Hubert Feyrer gave another talk about a similar theme. He described
 the use of Ansible for provisioning and setting up VMs. Ansible can
 automatically create VMs on EC2, gather the necessary information (such
 as the IP address) and do various setup tasks without further user
 interaction. This was all very impressive, even though the live demo
 failed. This was for two reasons: Somebody deleted the sudo package for
 amd64 from the NetBSD ftp server (boo), and the i386 VM failed to come
 up, the kernel paniced on startup. Joerg speculated that this was due
 to _some_ machines in their DC not having PAE enabled, while the i386
 kernel uses PAE. This was interesting, as I had noticed the very same
 problem when I set up the netbsd-386-bsiegert continuous builder for
 Go.</p>

<p>Amitai Schlair alias Schmonz came out in a passionate defense of the
 venerable pkglint. <a href="https://github.com/schmonz/pkglint">He put
 the source on github</a> and started refactoring the code
 and adding tests. He calls this approach TED for "Test Eventually
 Development" ;) and advocated a similar approach for the pkgsrc
 infrastructure: Every time a developer takes five minutes to understand
 a part of the infrastructure (when making a change, for instance), he
 or she should write a test for it. This is a very pragmatic and doable
 approach, in my opinion, and we should all do this.</p>

<p>I gave a slightly amended version of the "Go on NetBSD" talk I had
 given at FOSDEM 2013. There were a lot of valuable questions and
 discussion, both about the language and about how to package software
 written in it.</p>

<p>Aleksej Saushev ended the day with a talk that was not in the program
 about the Google Code-In and the problems that developers and
 particularly new contributors face. If pkgsrc can get more contributors,
 it gets more fixes, which in turn makes it more useful to users. More
 usefulness leads to more users, leading to more contributors. We should
 do more to get into this virtuous circle. There are about five
 different mechanisms to build and/or deploy packages in pkgsrc: build
 directly with "make package", pkg_chk, pkg_comp, the old bulk build
 scripts and pbulk. The basic frustration that should be overcome is the
 following: you want to upgrade a set of packages, the old ones are
 removed, new ones are rebuilt, and the build fails. Rolling back is
 difficult in general. pbulk could be a valuable solution to this, but
 its standard config is heavily tailored for a different use case, and
 its _two_ separate pieces of documentation are contradictory,
 incomplete and confusing. So the talk contained a call for action to
 fix those minor annoyances and generally document things better, which
 makes it easier for everybody.</p>

<p>My take-home message – and my next project idea – is the following:
 each time that I do a MirBSD bulk build using pbulk, I have to do a lot
 of painful steps to set up the right build environment on all my
 machines. This time, I will try to automate this process with Ansible,
 making up the recipes as I go along, and then (more importantly)
 publish these recipes for others to use and to share.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing too much lately, which has led to reduced performance
 and enjoyment. Also I’ve not been able to work the full hours of my
 dayjob, reducing what I had on my overtime account. I’ll be taking a
 step back and try to un-load. This is my notice, I’m not explicit on
 where, and I’m not cancelling anything special (not even those mentioned
 in the next paragraphs).</p>
<p>I’m disappointed with Google/Nianticproject Ingress. It’s frustrating
 (nothing lasts; also read <a
 href="https://plus.google.com/+KristianK%C3%B6hntopp/posts/gyV1wRnuwyo">this
 posting</a>), buggy, battery-draining, sometimes too time-consuming
 (especially with only GPRS) and I don’t get warm with the Android 2.3
 based Cyanogenmod on the borrowed device. Using it without a <em>big</em>
 screen device having the Intel map next to you is futile. I could go into
 detail but won’t. I won’t stop playing, as it’s a good excuse to go outside
 and combines somewhat with geocaching (unless you’re trying to actually
 play Ingress, in which case you’ll just be walking/cycling/driving between
 portals at maximum speed). And there’s that connection with Liferay…</p>
<p>Fun is important in securing volunteer work; bugs and <a
 href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.ports.68k/10993">other
 random happenings</a> (example) can drain the fun.</p>
<p>To end on a positive note, I’m absolutely, totally happy with <a
 href="mksh.htm">mksh</a> user and distributor feedback,
 including the bug reports and feature requests, how well almost all
 people deal with feature rejection, and the speed of integration of
 <a href="htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm" class="manlink">mksh(1)</a> updates lately. The only thing I’m unhappy wrt. mksh is my
 own lack of speed regarding implementing the cool new things I’ve
 been, as an mksh <em>user</em>, waiting for because I want and even
 <em>need</em> them for some cool programs written in mksh I would
 love to write, so I can use them.</p>
<p>I’ve got roughly 350 mails in my INBOX (all read, but most of them
 being action items; some due… before this weekend, evilly enough, the
 one I’m thinking of is GnuPG/MIME encrypted, which means extra effort
 to read it). Just so you know. (And a couple of other things that
 really could use some fixing, which I can, in theory, do. And lots of
 requests for spending real life time with.)</p>
<p>I’m still reachable via eMail and IRC (mostly), will respond, will
 try to persuade my employer to send me to CLT 2013 next month… just,
 don’t deadline me right now. I’m not taking a VACation either (though
 I probably should, had I money).</p>
