<p>Of course things like that don&#8217;t just stop there, after finding three different slideshows that might work, as I decided to try to make the web site iPhone/iPad/Android friendly and that took me down the Rapidweaver Theme rathole where I found that my original photo plugin didn&#8217;t play nice with newer themes.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ve rebuilt the web site using a new responsive theme, and found an app to build slideshows straight out of Adobe Lightroom. Only problem now is converting all those old slideshows into new (and improved) ones. Not helped by the lack of photo cataloging of the older photos.</p>
<p>It sounded so simple in the beginning&#8230;</p>

<p>Firstly the USA. While it‚Äôs not unusual for border protection in the USA to seem to act strangely I think they out did themselves this time. For the first time I was entering the USA via ship and at a territory (US Virgin Islands). This necessitated a face to face meeting with a customs agent on the ship. Nothing overly unusual there but I needed to bring a paper copy of my ESTA and fill out a I94-W form. I had thought the the ESTA had consigned the I94-W to history but it appears not if you are traveling by ship. Also it seems that the customs service doesn‚Äôt do mobile data as you need to appear with a paper copy of your ESTA. No idea how they determine that it‚Äôs legit but maybe that‚Äôs why they need the I94-W too.</p>
<p>Now in theory I‚Äôm in the USA and the ship continues its journey to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. You would think that customs in US Virgin Islands was sufficient but it would appear not as now we go through the passport check and the usual photograph and finger print fun and games. At least we do until we‚Äôre running late and then it reverts to a simple flash of the passport. Not sure how this is securing the borders, if they thought the finger print and photo was necessary for some but not all foreigners.</p>
<p>Next up Australia. I‚Äôve just returned to Australia via Perth Airport. I have an e-passport so I can use the SmartGate and it looked like it might be quicker, queues for both the kiosks and the agents. Anyway I queued for the kiosk. On inserting my passport it asks if I‚Äôve been to Africa, Caribbean, Central or South America. Well I‚Äôve been to them all on this trip so what next? Well now it presents a list of countries and regions asking if I‚Äôve been to any. Clearly a Yellow Fever test. I scan the list while the system nags me about answering the question. I spot an Argentine province I‚Äôve visited so answer yes. SmartGate tells me I need to seek out the information desk. On obvious sign where that is so I head to the agent line before all the people arriving from Bali or Dubai descend on it. Get to the agent and present my form, passport and immunisation booklet, which he ignores. Only question asked was whether my travel to Brazil (country most time spent in) was business or pleasure. I‚Äôm now waved through and the next person wants to know about the food I‚Äôm carrying. Clearly they happy with my answer as they notate my card and I proceed to collect the checked bag. Now onto the next queue where I think the positive answer to both the ‚Äúhave I been to Africa, Caribbean, Central or South America‚Äù question and the one about ‚Äúhave I been in a wilderness area‚Äù would get some further questions. Apparently not as I‚Äôve waved through to the exit unlike the 3 people in front of me. Got to wonder why those questions are there if no action (or even questions) is taken.</p>

Lots of photographs were taken but only one uploaded as the satellite based Internet service on the ship was unreliable and when it worked slow. While I couldn‚Äôt always see a mobile phone signal (and turned airplane mode on to save battery life) it would have probably been a whole lot better than satellite. I could understand why satellite would be problematic in Svalbard but Panama is a mystery.</p>

I usually use Picpress to create photo books but they don‚Äôt provide a way to share a preview of the book online so I‚Äôve created one for the Land of the Ice Bears cruise using Blurb. It has the added bonus of creating an iPad version but I lose the lie flat binding. Anyway I‚Äôve created the book and now just need to wait for my physical copy to arrive to see how it really turned out. Meanwhile I continue going through the images to create a book for Greenland.</p>
<p>Blurb also provide some code to access the preview so I‚Äôve embedded that here to see how that works <img src='http://fuji.mrp.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>While a documentary series like the BBC‚Äôs Frozen Planet can give you some sense of the beauty and fragility of these places there is nothing like actually being there, feeling the chill wind, the sound of glaciers calving, the smell of bird cliffs, etc. It also provides an opportunity to witness some magnificent sights such as a polar bear drama we witnessed.</p>
<p>In the distance we spotted an old male polar bear lying on the ice. As we drew close we discovered that he had company. Initially we thought that the female bear and cub close to him were waiting by a seal breathing hole but no they were lying there watching the male bear (although strictly speaking Mum was watching the male bear and the cub was watching Mum). The male was lying on what appeared to be a pillow of snow but that too proved to be incorrect as suddenly he pulled a baby beluga whale from the snow. When he did the great reveal and started eating it she challenged him but he saw her off (and her confused/frightened cub). Walking in the far distance were two more bears who nearly instantly changed direction and started to come in our direction.  First a young female came to challenge, perhaps indicating how hungry she was and then a young male. Both were scared away by the old, scared male but they all then set up camp not far from him (and us in the ship) to watch for another opportunity. I have no idea how it ended as we moved away while the old male was still eating with his audience of 4 other bears.</p>

Not that is a problem as Basecamp has a nice cosy loft area where I can sit with my iPad and listen to the rain. Somewhat glad that I didn‚Äôt do a cruise today to one of the Russian settlements as it probably won‚Äôt be a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Of course the weather changed again and while it‚Äôs still brisk the low cloud and rain have passed so it‚Äôs back to ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù and wandering around town weather. Went down to the harbour and noticed the signs warning of aggressive Arctic Terns. Sounded a lot like Adelaide‚Äôs aggressive Magpies. I saw some at a safe distance so I escaped without a welcome from them. There was a Greenpeace ship in the harbour, no idea why as I‚Äôm blissfully news free (well mostly, still trying to keep up with the TdF via twitter <img src='http://fuji.mrp.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>One last restaurant to try tonight, the one at the Radisson (I‚Äôm passing on the pizza joint, although it‚Äôs probably excellent).</p>

It seems that the Internode name servers haven‚Äôt updated. Looking closer it seems that Internode is using one to do the transfer and it‚Äôs being denied as it‚Äôs not one of the actual slaves. Fixed that but it seems that there is a race condition too. Had to update the SOA three times and get my server to send notifys to the Internode server to get it to a state where the rest of the data is up to date. Now need to wait for caches to refresh.
