  <p>
    NetApp is the leading provider of storage and data management solutions.
    Our Data ONTAP(r) GX software provides highly scalable grid storage that
    scales linearly to petabytes of storage and gigabytes-per-second of
    throughput.  As NetApp's solution for the high performance computing
    (HPC) market, our systems require extreme performance and high
    reliability while maintaining management simplicity.  FreeBSD is a basic
    building block of this product.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We leverage FreeBSD as a high quality and high reliability management
    framework that we integrate with our innovative storage solutions.
    NetApp has employed open source components and open standards from the
    outset and we've been contributing back to the community in turn.  The
    FreeBSD ecosystem, the well-established framework for communication,
    tracking bugs, and the friendly community have made it easy and
    enjoyable to contribute.

  <h2><a name="Netflix"><img
    src="/assets/Netflix_logo.jpg" alt="Netflix" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=100></a></h2>
  
  <p>
    More than 30 million Netflix streaming members around the globe
    watch more than a billion hours of movies and TV shows each month.
    In the US, Netflix video streaming accounts for a third of peak
    downstream Internet traffic. Netflix created Open Connect, a
    single-purpose content delivery network, to help deliver these
    petabytes of data.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The main component of Open Connect is the Open Connect Appliance,
    a small-footprint network streaming device. The Open Connect Appliance
    is a 4U Intel-based server that is designed to economically maximize
    storage density in a space and power footprint that is ideal for
    both ISP data centers and metro-area network interchanges.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Open Connect Appliance runs on FreeBSD 9. Netflix picked FreeBSD
    9 because it is a high performing, low-maintenance and reliable
    operating system that is supported by major hardware vendors. FreeBSD
    9 provides a foundation of reliability, performance, and hands-free
    manageability. Combined with NGINX, a light-weight and high performance
    Web server, FreeBSD 9 provides a simple but powerful solution that
    is capable of serving tens of thousands of simultaneous video streams
    across multiple 10Gbit fiber optic links.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Beyond its technical strengths, FreeBSD comes with an outstanding
    ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users who openly share
    expertise, talent, and technical improvements.  Netflix has embraced
    this community and is committed to giving back its bug fixes and
    enhancements, thus completing the circle of community collaboration.

  <p>
    iXsystems is a leading provider of server class hardware designed
    to run FreeBSD.  An integral part of our business strategy is to
    fund FreeBSD developers to continually improve and refine FreeBSD.
    Our internal infrastructure and services are based on FreeBSD,
    allowing us to easily identify areas in FreeBSD that need improvement.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We believe strongly that what is good for FreeBSD is good for our
    customers, and what is good for our customers is good for us.  The
    BSD License allows us to both use and contribute code freely, and
    allows our customers and the consumers of FreeBSD to do the same.
    FreeBSD has benefited from years of open sharing and collaboration
    which have resulted in a stable, mature, high performance operating
    system.

  <h2><a name="NYI">NYI</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    NYI is a data center provider that uses FreeBSD for all of its
    internal and customer-facing solutions for colocation and dedicated
    servers, cloud computing and managed services. Our  initial choice
    of technology included commercial Unix systems tied to proprietary
    hardware. However, the cost and portability of FreeBSD were determining
    factors in our changing platforms early in our company's existence.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since then, we have enjoyed the functionality and reliability of
    FreeBSD.  We rely on it for networking duties like routers, VPNs,
    firewalls and traffic shapers, as well as web applications like
    shared hosting, backend interfaces, load balancers and proxies. We
    particularly appreciate the community support and centralized
    documentation, which means that we do not have to hunt down bits
    and pieces of information, like we would with other projects.

  <h2><a name="EMC Isilon"><img src="/assets/donors/Isilon_EMC.jpg"
    alt="EMC Isilon."/></a></h2>
  
  <p>
    Isilon Systems chose FreeBSD because it is a modern, stable, high-performance
    *NIX operating system with very liberal licensing terms. We needed a strong
    and complete code base to start from so we can be 100% focused on our own
    product and have complete liberty to innovate so our product can be as great
    as it is.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Isilon benefits from using FreeBSD in a number of ways, but the most important
    benefit is that we are able to leverage the open source efforts of thecommunity to improve our product. Since we're part of that community,
    we provide source code back, sponsor specific development efforts, and employ
    members of the community for contract development - this in turn gives us
    access to great people and continued access to great software.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In short, FreeBSD is a stable, mature, high-performance operating system with
    an active development community free from licensing questions and concerns.
  </p>
  
  <p>So why is it important for us and others to keep FreeBSD free?</p>
  
  <p>
    FreeBSD is the only choice for individuals or companies who need complete
    freedom as they innovate. Licenses such as the CDDL and GPL force innovators
    to be very careful about how and where they build their code, which restricts
    their design choices and can lead to poor technical decisions or
    licensing-limbo. A vast majority of Isilon's innovation is in the kernel and
    our intellectual property is liberally scattered throughout.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This simply wouldn't have been possible using another open-source operating
    system - and licensing operating system source code is a steep barrier to
    entry.

  <p>
    Juniper offers high-performance network infrastructure powered by JUNOS (TM)
    software, one network operating system that integrates routing, switching,
    security and network services. FreeBSD serves as the basis of JUNOS software,
    providing many of the essential operating system services of the UNIX-based
    system. Today, JUNOS software runs on a broad portfolio of Juniper products
    designed for the diverse and demanding needs of converged networks, from small
    offices to the largest TeraPop sites in the world.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Juniper benefits from the powerful collaboration between leading universities,
    individuals, and commercial organizations developing FreeBSD to advance the
    operating system functionality. The FreeBSD release system provides Juniper
    with a roadmap for features and a stable base for our code, while its
    practical licensing enables Juniper to develop intellectual property for
    advancing high-performance networking. Juniper employs many active FreeBSD
    developers that continually contribute to the FreeBSD project to further its
    development as a leading operating system.

  <h2><a name="Experts">Experts Exchange</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    Experts Exchange is a technology help site located at experts-exchange.com --
    we've developed a patented Q&A system that makes finding solutions easier.
    People ask questions and experts from around the world provide reliable
    answers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since 2009, Experts Exchange has used FreeBSD as its operating system of choice
    for all external facing web servers and internal tools hosting.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    About 3 years ago, Experts Exchange did extensive performance testing of our
    website on several flavors of Linux and UNIX, including FreeBSD 7. FreeBSD
    outperformed all other tested operating systems in both page load time metrics
    and Lucene search index performance testing.  Since that time, we've migrated
    our developer, test and production servers to FreeBSD.  We've also used
    FreeBSD jails to host our developer test servers and have come to rely on
    FreeBSD throughout our local office datacenter and our co-location datacenter
    stack.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Because of our investment in FreeBSD, we continue to have several system
    administrators working on FreeBSD enhancements to improve our production
    environment and their changes hopefully help other companies and users as
    well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A big thank you to the FreeBSD community for your open, friendly attitude and
    how much you've contributed to the growth of Experts Exchange!

  <p>
    RideCharge, Inc. creates innovative technology solutions that improve
    local ground transportation industries. The company's most renowned
    product, Taxi Magic, is an online & mobile software application that
    revolutionizes the taxi industry by aligning riders, drivers and fleets
    for a better overall ride experience. Taxi Magic is the first nationwide
    free online taxi booking service that is directly integrated with taxi
    dispatch systems, providing consumers with the tools to:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Book a taxi from a mobile app or the Web with a few quick taps</li>
    <li>Track the taxi's arrival</li>
    <li>Charge the ride to a credit card through the mobile app</li>
    <li>Expense the trip with an e-receipt</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    From its inception, RideCharge has been entirely based on FreeBSD. By
    leveraging FreeBSD Jails for virtualization, we are able to maximize
    resources and expand dynamically.  ZFS keeps our data safe and our
    deployments magically quick.  Userland DTRACE in FreeBSD 9 is now an
    indispensable tool for troubleshooting issues in real-time. Even our
    Juniper firewalls and switches leverage FreeBSD through JUNOS (TM).
    iXsystems is incredibly helpful in recommending the correct setup and
    optimizing our technology resources to fit our needs for FreeBSD.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RideCharge is a long time contributor to the FreeBSD ports collection
    and we employ highly active contributors in the ruby, apache, and perl
    areas.  The Taxi Magic team leverages these incredibly tight feedback
    loops to quickly and efficiently contribute back to the community.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RideCharge/TaxiMagic has directly sponsored FreeBSD developers to
    enhance freebsd-update(8). We now use this update to quickly update
    every machine to maintain PCI DSS Level 1 compliance.  These great
    capabilities are now available to the entire FreeBSD community.

  <h2><a name="Apache">The Apache Software Foundation</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.apache.org">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>
    provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range
    of open source software projects. The Foundation provides an established
    framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that
    simultaneously limits contributors potential legal exposure.
    Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process, Apache
    projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software products
    that attract large communities of users. The pragmatic Apache License
    makes it easy for all users, commercial and individual, to deploy Apache
    products.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The ASF powers half the Internet, petabytes of data, teraflops of
    operations, billions of objects, and enhances the lives of countless
    users and developers. Established in 1999 to shepherd, develop, and
    incubate Open Source innovations, "The Apache Way," the ASF oversees
    150+ projects led by a volunteer community of over 350 individual
    Members and 3,000 Committers across six continents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ApacheCon North America 2011 was just recently held in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada where FreeBSD was a highlight in the DevOps
    track talks.  The Apache Software Foundation itself leverages FreeBSD
    for nearly all of its <a
    href="http://apache.org/dev/machines.html">public facing services</a>
    including one of the largest SVN repositories in the world.  Our
    repository is mirrored on several continents and contains over 1.4
    million revisions stretching for over a decade. We will even be lending
    a hand converting the FreeBSD CVS ports tree to SVN.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Apache Software Foundation makes use of both custom FreeBSD
    Tinderbox and FreeBSD Update servers to rapidly perform application and
    base system updates across multiple datacenters in an automated, quick,
    and efficient fashion. The Apache Infrastructure Team frequently works
    directly with FreeBSD developers to stress cutting-edge features like
    ZFS under real-world loads.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Like The FreeBSD Foundation, the ASF is also a 501(c)3 organization. 
    Donating to FreeBSD through The FreeBSD Foundation, makes Apache better 
    too and will help make your's and others' daily lives less stressful.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    We're grateful to you for creating the best, most reliable open
    operating system available today. At KACE, we've depended on
    FreeBSD for over 7 years as an essential component in the development
    of our leading systems management appliances. We initially chose
    FreeBSD because it is robust, scalable and offered under an
    unencumbered open source license that allowed KACE to freely develop
    software without the limitations imposed by other licenses. Moving
    forward, we'll continue to use FreeBSD for those very same
    reasons. As an integral part of our solution, and because FreeBSD
    continues to work so well, our products have developed a reputation
    for reliability that has helped fuel our company's success. 
    Based on our experience, we plan to expand our use of FreeBSD
    within KACE, as well as to evangelize its benefits throughout the
    Dell organization.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to the robustness and scalability of the OS, we also value
    the immense support offered by the community and the FreeBSD ecosystem.
    FreeBSD truly exemplifies the way that the open source community is
    meant to work - a meritocracy in which the sum of the parts is
    greater than the individual pieces. Working with the community is
    continually a pleasure, and only enhances our ability to creatively 
    develop our products. KACE continues to recognize the importance of
    the community through our enthusiastic support, and as we grow, we
    hope to develop more community members and participate in ways that
    deliver even greater benefits to all.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    When Hobnob solves a technical problem that is not specific to our
    core business we are free to sponsor that work and contribute it back
    to the community. However, when we have a major technological
    breakthrough that's critical to the future of the company, we're not

  <h2><a name="Summersault">Summersault Website Development</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    When a friend and I started our technology business 11 years ago in 1997, we
    didn't choose FreeBSD, it chose us.  But we're sure glad it did, and we came
    to build our company on FreeBSD.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a small website design and web application development firm, we didn't
    intend to get into the web hosting business.  We started hearing from our
    clients that they would appreciate being able to host their site through the
    same provider that built it for them, and so we decided to try offering that
    service as a convenience.  The local Internet service provider that we were
    sharing office space with had a FreeBSD 2.1 box with space on it, so we get
    our username and password, and we were up and running. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When we got big enough to need our own server for site hosting, we didn't
    spend too much time looking around at the options.  The consensus at the
    time (1998 now) was that Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD were all basically the
    same, and that it was mostly a matter of preference and what kind of
    commercial support was available to help you through any rough patches
    (though the license wars certainly raged on even then).  With our friends
    at the ISP sitting just on the other side of the bookshelves, we knew we
    had some of the best FreeBSD product support we could hope for.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 2000, our business model had largely shifted into building database
    driven website applications, and the expectations for what features came
    with a web hosting service had expanded significantly.  We were no longer
    just providing web hosting with Apache on FreeBSD - we knew we needed to
    support an expanding reliance on the PostgreSQL and MySQL database systems,
    the qmail and vpopmail e-mail systems and other dedicated services.  We
    started building new servers as dedicated single function boxes, and in each
    case, it was a no-brainer to install FreeBSD.  Our use of the ports system
    to turn it into just the kind of box we needed saved us lots of time along
    the way.  As we've transitioned into more "mainstream" hosting platforms
    like our use of cPanel, FreeBSD is still powering it behind the scenes. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may not necessarily need to hear that FreeBSD is a reliable platform
    for running Internet services.  But I think it's important to remember that
    software like FreeBSD is affecting the way that people live their lives
    every day, whether it's supporting businesses like ours, enabling hobbyists
    just getting into open source software, or any of the thousands of other
    "real world" roles it plays.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For much of the world, choice of operating system is an arbitrary decision
    to make.  We believe that for us, it's made all the difference in building
    a successful business.

  <h2><a name="colocation">Colocation America</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    Colocation America provides colocation, dedicated server, VoIP, and 
    managed data center hosting services for businesses that are looking 
    to host their servers in the United States. With 22 data center 
    locations, Colocation America has become one of the leading providers 
    of hosting services. Most of our customers depend on the FreeBSD 
    operating system to provide them with a secure environment to host 
    their network infrastructure. They praise FreeBSD for its ability to 
    encrypt sensitive data and for the ZFS advanced file system that makes 
    managing server files a breeze. Many of our corporate clients choose 
    to use FreeBSD to operate their MySQL database systems and email servers 
    due to the exceptional networking components of the operating system.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Developers that choose to colocate their servers with us also choose 
    to install FreeBSD on their dedicated servers. The open source nature 
    of the BSD license gives them the flexibility they need to develop 
    innovative software. Plus, they have access to an enterprise level 
    operating system that is free, has an active development community, 
    and which lets them contribute their own skills to make the system 
    better for their own development. We have asked several clients why 
    they decided to use FreeBSD and the answer has always been the same: 
    the cost and networking ability of the operating system rivals its 
    commercial license competitors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Our customers are not the only fans of FreeBSD. We use FreeBSD to 
    manage our shared hosting servers due to the OS ability to manage 
    firewalls and web applications while handling the server loads of 
    several hosting accounts at once. With the WebHost Manager cPanel 
    add-on for managing multiple web hosting accounts on a single 
    dedicated server, our shared hosting server is able to provide 
    customers looking for cheap website hosting. The community support 
    of FreeBSD, along with its open source nature, provides a secure 
    environment for our clients to host in. To find out more about the 
    dedicated server hosting with the FreeBSD operating system, you can
