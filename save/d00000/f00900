          Names, Registrars, and Registration</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial">The following is a list of frequently asked questions 
          (FAQs) about the domain name registration process and the new competitive 
          registration environment. It is expected that this list will be updated 
          frequently, so please check back often.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What is the domain name 
          system?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Domain Name System (DNS) 
          helps users to find their way around the Internet. Every computer on 
          the Internet has a unique address - just like a telephone number - which 
          is a rather complicated string of numbers. It is called its "IP address" 
          (IP stands for "Internet Protocol"). IP Addresses are hard to remember. 
          The DNS makes using the Internet easier by allowing a familiar string 
          of letters (the "domain name") to be used instead of the arcane IP address. 
          So instead of typing 207.151.159.3, you can type www.internic.net. It 
          is a "mnemonic" device that makes addresses easier to remember.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What does it mean to &quot;register&quot; 
          a domain name?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you register a domain 
          name, you are inserting an entry into a directory of all the domain 
          names and their corresponding computers on the Internet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How do I register a domain 
          name?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domain names ending with .aero, .biz, .com, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, .net, .org, or .pro can be registered through many 
          different companies (known as &quot;registrars&quot;) that compete with 
          one another. A listing of these companies appears in the <a href="http://www.internic.net/regist.html">Registrar 
          Directory</a> on this site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The registrar you choose 
          will ask you to provide various contact and technical information that 
          makes up the registration. The registrar will then keep records of the 
          contact information and submit the technical information to a central 
          directory known as the &quot;registry.&quot; This registry provides 
          other computers on the Internet the information necessary to send you 
          e-mail or to find your web site. You will also be required to enter 
          a registration contract with the registrar, which sets forth the terms 
          under which your registration is accepted and will be maintained.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will my name and contact 
          information be publicly available?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information about who is 
          responsible for domain names is publicly available to allow rapid resolution 
          of technical problems and to permit enforcement of consumer protection, 
          trademark, and other laws. The registrar will make this information 
          available to the public on a &quot;Whois&quot; site. It is however possible 
          to register a domain in the name of a third party, as long as they agree 
          to accept responsibility -- ask your registrar for further details.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How long does a registration 
          last? Can it be renewed?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each registrar has the flexibility 
          to offer initial and renewal registrations in one-year increments, with 
          a total registration period limit of ten years.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How much does a domain-name 
          registration name cost?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each registrar sets the price 
          it charges for registering names, and prices vary significantly among 
          different registrars. In addition, some registrars offer discounted 
          or free registration services in connection with other offerings, such 
          as web hosting. To see what offering best meets your needs, you should 
          go to the web sites of several of the registrars listed in the <a href="http://www.internic.net/regist.html">Registrar 
          Directory</a> on this site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Can I change registrars 
          after registering a domain name?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, you may change the registrar 
          sponsoring your domain name (60 days after intial registration.) For 
          details on the transfer process, contact the registrar you would like 
          to assume sponsorship of the registration.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I have seen advertisements 
          for domain-name registration by companies not in the accredited registrar 
          directory. Are these legitimate?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only registrars accredited 
          by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) are 
          authorized to register .aero, .biz, .com, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, .net, .org, or .pro names. Some 
          of these accredited registrars offer their services through resellers, 
          which may provide assistance in completing the registration process. 
          Your registration contract, however, will be with the accredited registrar 
          and that registrar will maintain your&nbsp; contact information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What is ICANN?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ICANN is the new non-profit 
          corporation that is assuming responsibility from the U.S. Government 
          for coordinating certain Internet technical functions, including the 
          management of Internet domain name system. More information about ICANN 
          can be found at <a href="http://www.icann.org">http://www.icann.org</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Someone else has registered 
          my company's name as a domain name. What is the process for resolving 
          my complaint?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All ICANN-accredited registrars 
          follow a uniform dispute resolution policy. Under that policy, disputes 
          over entitlement to a domain-name registration are ordinarily resolved 
          by court litigation between the parties claiming rights to the registration. 
          Once the court rules who is entitled to the registration, the registrar 
          will implement that ruling. In disputes arising from registrations allegedly 
          made abusively (such as &quot;cybersquatting&quot; and cyberpiracy&quot;), 
          the uniform policy provides an expedited administrative procedure to 
          allow the dispute to be resolved without the cost and delays often encountered 
          in court litigation. In these cases, you can invoke the administrative 
          procedure by filing a complaint with one of the dispute-resolution service 
          providers listed at &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm">http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm</a>&gt;. 
          For more details on the uniform dispute resolution policy, see &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm</a>&gt;, 
          and the FAQs at &lt;<a href="http://www.internic.net/faqs/udrp.html">http://www.internic.net/faqs/udrp.html</a>&gt;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>If I have customer service 
          questions or problems related to my domain name registration, who should 
          I contact?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You should contact the registrar 
          that registered your domain name.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What are the rules for 
          registration of .biz, .com, .info, .name, .net and .org names?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The .com, .info, .name, .net, and 
          .org TLDs are open and unrestricted. Traditionally, however, names in 
          .net have been used by organizations involved in Internet infrastructure 
          activities and .org is frequently used by noncommercial organizations. 
          .biz is reserved for use by businesses. For more information on .biz 
          restrictions, please contact your registrar or visit the .biz registry 
          operator at &lt;<a href="http://www.nic.biz">www.nic.biz</a>&gt;. .name
          is dedicated exclusively to individuals' personal names.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What are the rules for registration of .aero, .coop, and .museum names?</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The .aero, .coop, and .museum TLDs are sponsored TLDs and are designed for use within a specified community. Registration restrictions for these TLDs have been developed by the sponsor with input from the community. For more information on registering names in these TLDs, please contact your registrar or visit the individual registry sites at &lt;<a href="http://www.nic.aero">www.nic.aero</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="http://www.nic.coop">www.nic.coop</a>&gt;, or &lt;<a href="http://www.nic.museum">www.nic.museum</a>&gt;, respectively. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Are .aero, .biz, .com, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, 
          .net, .org, and .pro domain names available for registration in any country?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, these domains are available 
          for registration by Internet users across the globe; also, ICANN-accredited 
          registrars are located in countries around the world. To view a list 
          of domain name registrars sorted by country, please visit &lt;<a href="http://www.internic.net/origin.html">http://www.internic.net/origin.html</a>&gt;.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I've seen domain names 
          ending with two-letter combinations, like .uk. What are the rules for 
          registering in these domains?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two letter domains, such 
          as .uk, .de and .jp (for example), are called country code top level 
          domains (ccTLDs) and correspond to a country, territory, or other geographic 
          location. The rules and policies for registering domain names in the 
          ccTLDs vary significantly and some are reserved for use by citizens 
          of the corresponding country. You should check with the registrar offering 
          ccTLD registration services regarding the specific terms and conditions 
          for registration. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some ICANN-accredited registrars 
          provide registration services in the ccTLDs in addition to registering 
          names in .aero, .biz, .com, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, .net, .org, and .pro, however, ICANN does not specifically 
          accredit registrars to provide ccTLD registration services.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For more information regarding 
          registering names in ccTLDs, including a complete database of designated 
          ccTLDs and managers, please refer to &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld.htm">http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld.htm</a>&gt;.</font></p>
