<font size="2"
<p>The NSRC has been helping ISPs around the world for many years. Over time 
  we have seen many tools, tactics, and different methodologies for putting together 
  ISPs. Based on our experience and expertise we present what we believe to be 
  relevant information to help you get started and tools and methods that we have 
  found to work. We present this information based on experience. And, based on 
  this experience we do not, generally, recommend Microsoft solutions to build 
  a reliable and secure ISP infrastructure. We do, however, present information 
  about Microsoft products to allow you to place them in context. In addition, 
  we cannot stress strongly enough the importance of planning for the future in 
  every aspect of your ISP's development. If you are successful as an ISP, then 
  your implementation must be able to scale with your success.</p></font>

<h3><a name="core_services"></a> Core Services and Managing Them Locally </h3>
<font size="2">
  <p>As an ISP you will be responsible for maintaining several core services that 

    your clients use to gain Internet connectivity. Some of the most critical 

    are DNS, DHCP, and maybe dialup. Each of these is discussed below with pointers to information about setting them 

    up and using them.</p>




  <a name="dns"></a>  <p><b>DNS </b>(Domain Name Server)</p>
    <p>It's important that you set this up correctly from a functional standpoint. 

      For instance, you run your primary DNS server locally, but ideally you should 

      have your secondary, or backup, DNS server on a different network. This 

      way if your other network functions are up, but your DNS box is down your 

      clients can still make use of their Internet connections. </p>

    <p>Below we present some first-level discussion of DNS, then we have more 

      comprehensive list of Registries and DNS setup and maintenance links, including 

      mulitple RFCs and their descriptions.</p>

  <a name="dhcp"></a><p><b>DHCP </b>(Dynamic Host Control Protocol)</p>

    <p>DHCP is not all that difficult to setup, but in a large environment it 

      is important to decide upon the rules of engagement. If you have a fixed 

      number of IP addresses then how you allocate them, for how long, and who 

      gets static IP addresses becomes important. As you implement your DHCP services 

      consider the following issues:</p>



<ul>

  <li> 

    What devices get static IP addresses. Generally this includes 

      things like printers, routers, servers, and anything else that must have 

      the same IP address everytime it is turned on.

  </li>

  <li>How long are your DHCP leases? That is, how long until an IP address is 

    recycled back in to your IP address pool? For dialup connections this is usually 

    as soon as the client disconnects.</li>

  <li>Build a dhcpd.conf file that is well documented and laid out by located 

    (networks) so that it is easy to update and maintain. 

    <p>One of the best DHCP resources is the man pages for dhcp. Simply type &quot;man 

      dhcp&quot; at the operating system prompt under any UNIX system to get started. 

      The current version of the DHCP server for UNIX can be found at:</p>

   <a name="dialup"</a> <p><b>Dialup (RADIUS) </b></p>

    <p>Setting up a process by which you authenticate users dialing in to your 

      network (modem pool) is likely to be a critical piece of your operation 

      as an ISP. In addition this is one point at which you can monitor user access 

      to your services and keep track of usage for billing or statistical purposes. 

      Below is a short list of some excellent Radius resources:</p>

  <a name="proxy"></a><p><b>Proxy and Cache Servers</b></p>
<font size="2">
      <p>World Wide Web proxy servers speed up the access to web based resources 

        by locally storing copies of frequently accessed web sites. Instead of 

        having to reconnect to a slow webserver, after the first view, the web 

        page will be served from the local proxy cache. This results in much faster 

        page views than reloading the page from the origional server. The more 

        disk space on your proxy, the better chance you will have of improving 

        the performance of your client's web browsing as well as reducing the 

        total bandwitdth used for your incoming network connection(s). The most 

        widely used, and freely available, proxy server for Linux and FreeBSD 

        is squid. You can find this at <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</a>.

        The NSRC recommends and uses Exim whenever possible running under FreeBSD. 

        Exim is very secure and has been used in extremely large-scale implementations 

        (up to a million users!).</p>
<ul>
        <li><b>Exim</b></li>

        <p>Exim has been shown to scale to massive implementations, is generally 

          easier to implement than sendmail, and is quite secure. You can read 

          about the latest book, written by the auther of Exim (Philip Hazel), 

          at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/exim/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/exim/</a>.

        </p>

        <li><b>Postfix</b></li>

        <p>Another alternative to sendmail. Previously known as vmailer and as 

          the IBM Secure Mailer when released in 1998. Postfix is preferred by 

          administers at some sites. Read all about it, download it, and find 

          updates at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</a>.</p>

        <li><b>Qmail</b></li>

        <p>qmail is famous for its ease of use, quick response to reader input 

          for changes, and the $1,000 reward to the first person who could crack 

          it - the prize went unclaimed and there is currently a $500 prize that

        <li><b>Sendmail</b></li>

        <p>Sendmail is the grandfather of Open Source MTA programs. O'Reilly has 

          printed the definitive sendmail guide that you can read about at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail2/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail2/</a>,

          The main sendmail site is located at <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">http://www.sendmail.org/</a>. 

          One thing to be aware of is if you use sendmail there are numerous security 

          exploits with this product. Whatever you do, <i>do not run old versions 

          of sendmail!</i> There are well-known, and commonly exploited security 

          issues. You should make it a point of keeping your sendmail versions 

          up-to-date.<b><br>

          </b> </p>
</ul>


        <p><b><a name="mta"></a>General Issues with MTAs</b></p>

        <p>sendmail has been the de facto standard of mail delivery agents for 

          years, but with the maturing of products such as Exim and qmail this 

          is no longer as true. </p>

        <p>If you need to scale your mail server there are two things that can 

          help dramatically:</p>


    <b>Email Delivery - IMAP/POP/Webmail/Console</b>


      <p><br>

        This is a difficult topic. Which protocol or method do you wish to use 

        to allow your users access to their email on your site? There is no perfect 

        answer to this question. Generally the answer you come up with will be 

        a balance of security, reliability, and convenience. </p>

      <p>The fundamental issue will come down to whether you use IMAP, POP, or something like 
webmail as your primary mail access method. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are described below. If you choose to use IMAP, then there are 

        several IMAP servers available for use. Generally IMAP servers will include 

        POP servers as well. You can read about some of the IMAP servers available 

        for FreeBSD/UNIX/Linux at <a href="http://www.imap.org/">http://www.imap.org/</a>. 

        A popular IMAP server for UNIX/FreeBSD/Linux come from the University of Washington and is availble at: <a href="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">http://www.washington.edu/imap/</a>.<font color="#000000"> 

        And for a long list of IMAP products see:</font></p>

      <p><a href="http://www.imap.org/products/longlist.htm">http://www.imap.org/products/longlist.htm</a></p>

      <p><b>Summary of Email Delivery Mechanisms and Links</b></p>


<ul>
        <li><b>IMAP</b>: The email client that understands the IMAP protocol can 

          see the message headers and folder names on your server, but actual 

          email is not downloaded to the client machine until a message is opened. 

          In addition, email stays on the server once a session is over. </li>
   <ul>
	<p><li><b>Advantages</b></li>

            You can use any IMAP enabled client and see your email in a consistent 

            manner from any workstation with an IMAP-enbabled client.<br>

            <br>

            The end-user does not need to backup their email as it remains on 

            a central server, which is most likely to be backed up regularly.<br>


	<p><li><b>Disadvantages</li></p>

            </b>You (the system administrator) must allocate enough space to hold 

            email for each user. If email is an important aspect of a user's life, 

            then you may need to consider 100MB/User, or more, of space!<br>

            <br>

            The user must remain (generally) connected during an entire IMAP session. 

            In many countries this is very expensive, or impractical.<br>

            <br>

            Even though, in theory, users can check their email from any IMAP-enabled 

            client, this is non-trivial. The user is likely to leave traces of 

            email, password and account information, etc. on any machine where 

            they set this up. In addition, setup is non-trivial. <br>

            <br>

            If the user cannot access the IMAP server, then they do not have access 

            to their email.</p>

</ul>
<p>
        <li><b>POP</b>: With this protocol the email client downloads email from 

          the server to the client machine. The POP protocol is smart enough to 

          know what messages are new and in what state they are. That is, if you 

          read them on-line, then when they are downloaded they will not be marked 

          as new. In addition. the user can decide to leave the messages on the 

          server, delete them, delete them after a certain period of time (POP3), 

          or delete them only when they empty trash on their machine. <font color="#000000">The 

          UW IMAP server comes with POP as well and can be found at:</font></li>



          <p><a href="http://www.washington.edu/imap/">http://www.washington.edu/imap/</a></p>
<ul>
         <li> <p><b>Advantages</p></li>

            </b>As long as the user can connect to the Internet, then they can 

            probably download their messages using POP.</p>

          <p>The end user can have their email saved in multiple places (server, 

            desktop at work, laptop for the road, desktop at home).</p>

          <p>POP allows you to &quot;pop&quot; (i.e., &quot;get&quot;) email in 

            a single, quick session, then work on the email received offline and 

            send them at the next opportunity without needing to be constantly 

            connected.</p>

          <p>Many, many clients speak and understand POP.</p>

          <li><p><b>Disadvantages</p></li>

            </b>Many users become very confused as to the state of their email. 

            The often do not know where the latest download is or how to keep 

            their mail syncronized. POP on multiple machines <i>is not</i> for 

            novice users.</p>

          <p>Running POP from multiple locations can cause problems.</p>

          <p>Many uses forget to ever delete email from the server, and will fill 

            their disk space, which results in rejected email by most systems.</p>

          <p>If the user evers gets (i.e., &quot;pops&quot;) their email to a 

            foreign system, then their email is on that system unless the user 

            remembers to delete it.</p>
</ul>
        <li><b>Webmail</b>: This method allows a user to connect to the Internet and 

          get their email from within a web browser. Generally email stays on 

          the system and it is generally much easier to deliver email in a secure 

          fashion using webmail. RoundCube is an excellent web mail client, it is available at: <a href="http://roundcube.net/">http://roundcube.net/</a></li>
<ul>

          <li><b>Advantages</b><br></li>

            <p> To secure webmail you just need to run a secure webserver. This 

            is generally easier than generating certificats to run POP or IMAP 

            servers in secure mode.</p>

          <p>Users can get their email from any machine with a web browser and 

            an Internet connection. This bears repeating... Users can get their 

            email from any machine in the world with a web browser and an Internet 

            connection. This singlehandedly has made Microsoft's Hotmail one of the most successful 

            email clients in the world.</p>

          <p>Their are many webmail servers to choose from and many are free.</p>

         <li> <p><b>Disadvantages<br></li>

            </b>Email remains on the server. If you don't have an Internet connection, 

            then you don't have access to your email.</p>

          <p>The webmail interface, filter abilities, etc. are often inferior 

            to what standalone clients may offer.</p>

          <p>You may have to put up with advertising or large amounts of spam 

            (see Microsoft Hotmail in this regard) to use a webmail service.</p>
</ul>

          <li><b>Console-Based</b>: This is generally any email client that runs directly 

          on the server where your email resides, but that presents your email 

          in a text-only format usually in a telnet or ssh terminal session window. 

          We <i>strongly</i> recommend you use console-based clients with ssh 

          connections only. A few common console-based email programs include 

         Alpine (<a href="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/">http://www.washington.edu/alpine/</a>), 

          which is the most popular. The &quot;mail&quot; program 

          is almost always available in any UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD flavor. Mail is much 

          more rudimentary, but is functional for sending and receiving email. 

          Note that console-based clients do not really apply to Windows servers 

          as the concept of connecting to the server wth a shell is not well supported.</li>
<ul>
          <li><b>Advantages</b> 

            Your email is always available and backed up on a central server.

          <p>Console-based email packages such as Pine are 100% compliant when 

            it comes to email standards (i.e., they tend to send ASCII only!).</p>

          <p>You can manipulate your email directly and with considerable power 

            once you learn the console-based client well.</p>

          <p>You can access your email from any Internet connected machine that 

            runs telnet (most all machines, but this is not secure!) or ssh.</p></li>

         <li><b>Disadvantages</li>

            </b>You must connect to the server to get your email. This is not 

            strictly true. If you understand how to do this you can download your 

            current &quot;Inbox&quot; from the server to a local machine and run 

            a console-based email client, like Pine, on your local machine. This 

            is similiar to what you can do with POP.</p>

          <p>If you connect to the server, then you must stay connected to send 

            and receive email. This is expensive and impractical in some situations 

            or countries.</p>

          <p>If you are connected over a slow connection, then typing in telnet 

            or ssh can be painfully slow.</p>
</ul>

    <li><b>Conclusion</b> </p>

    <p>When you pick the system that you are going to support you will have several 

      tradeoffs between ease of use, security, reliability of the connection method, 

      and cost. Webmail has become very popular and allows you to secure the email 

      sessions easily. Remember, SSL connections require considerably more CPU 

      time so you must scale your hardware appropriately. Webmail, however, requires 

      a constant connection. POP clients are good for users who want to get their 

      email, download it, disconnect, respond, reconnect and send. But, POP is 

      largely insecure. Most POP clients will talk  to a POP server via SSL. We strongly recommend you implement this since 

      POP without SSL passes a user's password and ID in clear text each time 

      they check for mail.</li>

    <p>One final issue to remember if you, or your users, run multiple protocols 

      for accessing email is that these methods can cause problems with the state 

      of email. For instance, some versions of POP and IMAP do not mix well. If 

      you "touch" your mailbox using IMAP, and then attempt to access it using 

      POP you may find that POP suddenly thinks that all your messages are new 

      again. In addition, dependent on the servers in use, a user trying to access 

      their email from multiple locations using multiple protocols at once can 

      cause problems. Generally the first process accessing the email will lock 

      out others from having write access, but this is not always guarranteed 

      under all circumstances.

 <a name="security"></a><h3>Security</h3><font size="2">
  <p>Securing your system from attack is a basic responsibility of any good system 

    administrator. Doing this is not an easy task and staying on top of how to 

    secure you system is of critical importance. At this stage of the Internet ) if you do not secure your site, then you are guaranteed to 

    be compromised. Your site will be broken in to and you are likely to lose 

    data, have data corrupted, and lose service. Securing your system and knowing 

    how to respond to security threats and breaches is of the utmost importance. 

    If you have any doubts about this you should see statistics from the HoneyNet 

    Project at <a href="http://project.honeynet.org/">http://project.honeynet.org/</a>, 

    which includes reports of one unsecured Linux box that was compromised within 

    45 minutes of being placed on the net.</p>

<p>Below we give you a few basic guidelines about securing network servers, but <i>before</i> you 
install, configure and place a server on-line we strongly suggest that you read our entire security document
located at (opens in a separate window):
<a href="http://nsrc.org/security/" target="_blank">http://nsrc.org/security/</a>

This document contains detailed advice, pointers, and specific information about the steps you need to secure your
network servers. You should do this before you allow any of your servers to be connected to the Internet.</p>

  <p>Security is an ongoing process, but there are some basic guidelines you can 

    follow to secure most servers. Securing an entire network involves additional 

    planning and work. Larger organizations will usually have an entire staff 

    person dedicated to security. Generally, security is much easier to implement 

    if you do it from the start and you provide just the services you need vs. 

    providing everything out of the box and then trying figure out what you can 

    turn off.</p>

  <p><b>General Guidelines</b></p>

  <p>Very quickly, here are some general guidelines for securing a server on your 

    network. If you are new to security be sure that you go to some of the links 

    listed below and read them in depth. A few pointers include:</p>


<ul>

  <li> 

    <div align="left"><i>Turn off unnecessary services</i>: If you don't need 

      to run that printer daemon on your FreeBSD box, then don't. It has security 

      holes!</div>

  </li>

  <li> 

    <div align="left"><i>Use Filters:</i> That is filter the packets that come 

      in to your system and do not let all of them through to the services that 

      are running. This includes using tools like inetd or xinetd on your Linux 

      server.</div>


  <li> 

    <div align="left"> <i>Segregate services on different boxes</i>: If you plan 

      on running telnet or sendmail or other insecure servers, and you need to 

      run core services to keep your business up, then consider splitting these 

      to separate boxes. That way if one is compromised your whole network set 

      of services is not compromised.</div>

  </li>

  <li> 

    <div align="left"><i>Put some services behind firewalls</i>:<i> </i>Many organizations 

      see firewalls as a guaranteed way to protect their network. But, the problem 

      with a firewall is that you often must open ports on the firewall to allow 

      your users access to the services they want to use. And, you probably guessed 

      this, the services your clients want to use are the most likely ones to 

      come under attack. All is not lost, however, as a firewall can certainly 

      reduce security problems from port scans, less used services, etc.</div>

  </li>

  <li> 

    <div align="left"><i>Keep up with patches! </i>Pay attention to security patches 

      for the operating system and services you are using. Apply them, especially 

      when they address security holes. If a security hole is found in a service 

      you run it is almost a guarrantee that your server will be attacked and 

      compromised quickly (hours or days) once this hole becomes well know.</div>

  </li>

  <li><i>Consider System Integrity Checkers: </i>Including things such as the 

    samhain (available at: <a href="http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/">http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/</a>). These products have secured known 

    databases of your filesystem. If anything changes that you do not expect to 

    change, then you are likely to be notified and you can deal with the problem. 

    Tripwire, and such systems are hard to install and are really only effective 

    if you install them right when you first build your server. Once you rserver 

    has been built and running for a while, then you do not know if it has been 

    compromised or not.</li>


</ul>


</ul>

<a name="backup"></a> <h3>Backup </h3><font size="2">

  <p>This cannot be stressed enough. At some point you will lose data. Your system 

    will experience a hardware failure. You may have a security breach that results 

    in data loss or corruption. The power will go out or or spike. You will experience 

    a natural or man-made disaster. One of these, or more, is guarranteed to happen. 

    Your only method for recovering from such situations is to have a safe, usable, 

    tested (many people forget this step), and reliable backup of your data.</p>

  <p>How you decide to implement this will depend on your hardware setup, amount 

    of data that needs backing up, and your budget. The general rule of thumb 

    is the easier and more data backed up, then the more expensive the solution. 

    Often administrator's attempt to backup entire systems, when the real goal 

    is to be able to get your user's data back and your current configuration 

    up and running.</p>

  <p>When designing your network and server setup try to design so that unique 

    configuration files and user data is segmented in to distinct areas. If, for 

    instance, you know that you need to backup /home, /data/ and a few system 

    directories like /etc, /usr/local, etc., then your backup setup and configuration 

    will be much easier.</p>

  <p>Your next step is to decide how quickly you need to be able to recover your 

    system and user's data in case of failure. Remember, even if you decide this 

    must be fast, you will need the additional hardware and ability to restore 

    to that hardware to make this happen.</p>

<a name="physical"></a> <h3>Physical Infrastructure</h3><font size="2">

  <p><font color="#000000">When planning to set up an ISP be sure that you pay 

    close and careful attention to your physical space and infrastructure. It 

    is easy to think about hardware and software, but forget about the supporting 

    pieces. Below are items that you should consider and links to some good pages 

    that discuss these are in more detail: </p>


<ul>

  <li>  <p><b>Space and Power</b></p>

    <p>Do you have a large enough space set aside to hold your staff and your 

      equipment? In addition, can you get the necessary power and phone lines 

      to your chosen location. Are there any issues with the location and bringing the 

      network to that location? What about power? If you include air conditioning, 

      servers, desktop machines, modems, routers, switches, etc are there enough? 

      You should probably do some planning to figure out how much power your equipment 

      will need, then how far you can scale before you run in to problems.</p></li>

  <li>  <p><b>Racks and Wiring</b></p>

    <p>As your organization grows you will quickly realize that having a well 

      thought out and clean system for your patch cables in place can save you 

      countless hours of crawling around, tracking ends, and accidentally disconnecting 

      machines. In addition, this can be faciliated by placing your switches, 

      routers, hubs, and CPUs in racks.</p></li>


   <li> <p><b>UPS and/or Generators</b></p>

    <p>If your area experiences power outtages, brown-outs, or power spikes, then 

      you will need more robust UPS equipment. But, in all cases you need to protect 

      your equipment with a Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) system and/or a generator. 

      Power that is not clean can cause serious damage to equipment. If you lose 

      your modems due to a power outtage or spike, then how long will it take 

      before you are back up and running? If the answer is days or weeks, then 

      your business is not likely to survive such outtages. A reliable and robust 

      system of UPSs and/or generators becomes critical. A great place to start 

      planning for what you will need is the American Power Conversion web site 

      at <a href="http://www.apcc.com/">http://www.apcc.com/</a>.<font color="#FF0000"> 

      <font color="#000000"> They have excellent UPS products, but they also have 

      very useful on-line planning tools as well.</font> </font></p></li>

    <h3>Client Support/Help Desk</h3> <font size="2">

  <p>Implementing a proper Help Desk from the beginning will be critical to your 

    long term success. If you can get clients up and running quickly with your 

    service and you can support them well, then it will be all that much easier 

    to grow. For a detailed look at how to set this up and to see what some other 

    organizations have done take a look at our Help Desk section at:</p>


<ul>

  <li>

    <div align="left"><a href="http://www.nsrc.org/helpdesk/">http://www.nsrc.org/helpdesk/</a></div>

  </li>

</ul>


<p>Trying to implement a help desk after you have attracted a large user base 

    can be quite painful. If you read through the pages above, particularly the 

    ones at the NSRC, you will get a good feeling for what you are likely to be 

    implementing as your ISP becomes successful and grows. A Help Desk and Support 

    organization does not stop at just creating a number, or email address where 

    your customers can reach you, but becomes a philosophy behind how you provide 

    service. Remember, this document stresses scalability in all phases of your 

    operation. This includes how what you do will affect your ability to be able 

    to support your clients. The NSRC Help Desk pages, particularly the Setting 

    up a Functional Support Organization section (<a href="http://www.nsrc.org/helpdesk/creating.html">http://www.nsrc.org/helpdesk/creating.html</a>) 

    goes over these ideas in detail with practical examples and solutions.</p>
