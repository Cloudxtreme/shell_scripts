    <h3>About Tarsnap</h3>
    <div class="boxcontents">
      <p>
	Work on Tarsnap began in September 2006 when the author, Dr. Colin
	Percival, decided that he wanted a
	<a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2006-09-13-encrypted-backup.html">better
	online backup service</a> than was presently available.  After
	slightly more than two years of development and private beta testing,
	Tarsnap officially entered public beta in November 2008, and attained
	profitability in February 2009.  In September 2011, Tarsnap Backup Inc.
	was incorporated in British Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Tarsnap client code is built around the open source
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/">libarchive</a> archive
	handling library.  While the Tarsnap code is not distributed under an
	open source license, Tarsnap contributes back to the open source
	community via bug fixes and enhancements to libarchive (40 commits
	and counting) and by releasing entirely new code where possible
	(e.g., the <a href="scrypt.html">scrypt</a> key derivation function
	and file encryption code).
      </p>
      <p>
	At the present time, the Tarsnap service is provided using
	infrastructure from
	<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>.

    <h3>About the author</h3>
    <div class="boxcontents">
      <p>
	Dr. Colin Percival studied mathematics at Simon Fraser University,
	entering at age 13, before going on to a doctorate in Computing at
	Oxford University, where his thesis covered problems in string
	matching, data compression, and file synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
	In January 2004, Colin became a FreeBSD committer and a member of the
	FreeBSD Security Team; he became the Security Officer for FreeBSD in
	August 2005, a position which he has held since.  Aside from his
	work as FreeBSD Security Officer, he is probably best known in the
	FreeBSD community for his work on FreeBSD Update and Portsnap.
      </p>
      <p>
	In addition to direct experience handling security issues via his
	experience as FreeBSD Security Officer, Dr. Percival has published
	several <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/papers/">research
	papers</a> in areas ranging from numerical analysis to cryptography,
	including <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/papers/htt.pdf">the
	first published cryptographic attack against shared caches in Intel's
	"HyperThreaded" processors</a>.
