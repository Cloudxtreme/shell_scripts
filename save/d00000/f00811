<h2>What is a cluster?</h2>
<p>
A cluster is a set of 2 or more drafts that are moving through the
<abbr>RFC</abbr> <a href="pubprocess.html">publication
process</a> together for one of the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are linked by normative references directly.</li>
  <li>They are linked by normative references indirectly (i.e., 2nd or 3rd generation).</li>
  <li>There was a specific request from the IESG or authors for simultaneous publication.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Generally, clusters are based on the principle that a normative
reference must be published before (or with) the document that
references it.  For example, if Draft A has a normative reference to
Draft B, and Draft B has a normative reference to Draft C, then Draft
A, B, and C would be in one cluster (i.e., labeled with the same
Cluster ID). See
the list of <a href="all_clusters.php">all active
clusters</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to drafts in
the <a href="state_def.html">queue
    states</a>, clusters can include documents that are not in the queue:
<dl>
  <dt><b>NOT-RECEIVED</b><dd>This document is not yet in the <abbr>RFC</abbr> Editor queue.</dd>
  <dt><b>PUB</b><dd>This document has been published as an <abbr>RFC</abbr>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>What is a normative reference?</h2>

<p>
A normative reference contains information essential to understanding or
implementing the document that references it. See the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/normative-informative.html">IESG Statement on Normative and Informative References</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2>Further Details</h2>

<p>
The Cluster ID is persistent over time. 

When all the documents in a cluster are published, the cluster no
longer appears in the list of active clusters.

In a cluster, there is at least one draft that is currently in the queue.
