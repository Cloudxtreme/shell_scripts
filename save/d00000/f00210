  <p>About me:- Thirty(ish) years ago I left my Post-Grad research and career as a tutor in Physiology (continuing as Teaching Associate at the Asia Pacific Research Institute of Macquarie University during the early 2000 years) to operate our family owned micro enterprise, Hovtek Pty. Limited, see <a href="http://www.hovtek.com.au/">http://www.hovtek.com.au</a>; and still do so today.</p>
  <p>I am a telecommuter, and licensee of domain names in .au as well as in the global DNS, but most importantly, I am an avid end-user of the Internet for work and recreation. Twelve years ago we started a spin off project called BuildersNet, which was developed from some of the TQM (ISO-9002 etc.,) activities of Hovtek. Eight years ago this became a stand-alone Pty Limited Australian Company, and relies totally on the Internet to facilitate its operation <u><a href="http://www.buildersnet.com.au/">http://www.buildersnet.com.au/</a></u>. Our clients in Australia are Micro Businesses and SMEs - and internationally mainly SMEs and Government or Aid Funded bodies; We service and communicate with them almost exclusively online and the majority of our importation of raw materials and products as well as export documentation bookings etc. is now handled that way.</p>
  <p>I believe the Internet should be seen as a public asset and needs to be developed and maintained as a cost-effective and accessible resource for communication, education, community, social and business opportunities by the Australian and wider global community; my work within ICANN with its remit as the coordinator of the unique identifiers (addressing) across i.e. in the Naming, Numbering and Nomenclature within the Internet Ecosystem with its commitment to a multi-stakeholder, bottom-up consensus driven policy development model is an essential part of this aim.</p>
  <p>My focus and ongoing interests are not specifically technical but rather more consumer and end user focused. Until May 2009 when the Council was dissolved I represent ISOC-AU in the Australian Communication Alliance Consumer Advisory Council) see <a href="http://www.acif.com.au/">http://www.acif.com.au/</a> with a keen interest in Policy Development, Access, Outreach and Regulatory issues.</p>
  <p>I was an Individual Member (prior to the formation of our Chapter) of ISOC and am a Director of ISOC-AU (see <a href="https://www.isoc-au.org.au/">https://www.isoc-au.org.au/</a>) since being elected in 2001 serving as Hon Treasurer from 2003-09, and currently serve as the Hon. Company Secretary on the executive&hellip; For more about my role and about the other Directors of ISOC-AU see <a href="http://isoc-au.org.au/Organisation/Dirs.html">http://isoc-au.org.au/Organisation/Dirs.html</a></p>
  <p>I am a Member of auDA, having been re-elected as a Board Member for my fourth term of office in the Demand Class (User Interests) stakeholder category in October 2012 I am standing for a 5th 2 year term. See <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/board/members/">http://www.auda.org.au/board/members/</a>; having previously I have worked on several auDA Policy Advisory Panels between 2000 and 2004, and as the Chair of the Domain Name Industry Code of Practice Committee.</p>
  <p>In 2008 and 2009 in addition to my work within APRALO and ALAC and specifically within the arena of communications consumer advocacy in Australia I was instrumental in the formation of a new National peak body to act as a co-ordinated voice of communications consumers Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN)</p>
