<H1>
The spam tools mailing list
</H1>
<I>Updated July 27, 2002</I>
<P>
The spamtools mailing list is dedicated to software tools that detect
and process unsolicited bulk e-mail.  The digest version of the list
is called spamtools-digest.
<P>
Tools for any platform are of interest, although most user-level tools
are written for Unix and for Windows, and most server-level tools are
for Unix.
<P>
Please limit the discussions to tools; we all agree that spam is bad
and that we wish that spammers would, at a minimum, go away, so those
topics are NOT appropriate for this list.  The list is unmoderated but
persistently unruly members will be ejected.
