  <p align=justify><font size=+1>This page contains various FreeBSD
    related bits &amp; pieces from Brian Somers that may be of interest to
    the general public.  More software from me (most of it related to FreeBSD
    :-) is available at <a href="http://www.Awfulhak.org/freebsd.html">

  <h3>Ppp</h3>

  as of December 30, '03 are available.  You should only use the binary
  archive if you're running a version of FreeBSD fairly close to the archive
  version.

  <p align=justify>You can also see the relevant bits of the
  <a href="usrsbin.log">usrsbin</a>, <a href="share.log">share</a> and
  <a href="lib.log">lib</a> <b>CVS</b> logs.

  <p align=justify>If you're interested in how ppp has been <i>hacked</i>,
  <a href="mkppp">this script</a> is used to generate the archives.

  <p align=justify>If you are not familiar with how to extract or build the
  archives, or if you're interested in pointers to all the <b>ppp
  documentation</b> that I know about, take a look at
  <a href="http://www.Awfulhak.org/ppp.html">http://www.Awfulhak.org/ppp.html
  </a> for some precise instructions. If you're using a brain-dead
  browser that can't download files in binary mode (notably Netscape
  under M$-Windows), you can download the uuencoded
  <a href="src.uue">source</a> and <a href="bin.uue">binary</a> archives
  instead.

  <p align=justify>All you have to do is download the archives, unpack them
  (they're compressed tarballs) and do a <code>make install</code>.  You'll
  need to do a <code>make</code> on the source archive first though.  The
  <code>install</code> will set the appropriate permissions etc - check out
  the README file in the top level directory for further details.

  <p align=justify>These sources are an <i>automatically mangled</i> version
  of the <b>-current</b> sources.  The <i>automatic mangling</i> makes it
  possible to build them on any version of FreeBSD from version 2.0.5 onwards.
  They should compile reasonably cleanly on OpenBSD and NetBSD too !

  <h3>Setcon</h3>

  <p>The <a href="setcon.tgz">sources for <b>setcon</b></a> are also
  available.  <b>Setcon</b> is a program that switches the current console
  under FreeBSD in the same way that pressing CTRL-ALT-F? will.  It is useful
  on some pre-2.2.2 systems if your keyboard has a tendency to freeze.  Of
  course, you'll need to be able to access the machine accross a LAN or
  serial connection in order to run the program....
