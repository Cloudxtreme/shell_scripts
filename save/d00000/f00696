              <p>&ldquo;I have worked closely with AMS and in particular with the Executive Director when they transitioned to take over secretariat duties at the IETF and provide new infrastructure tooling. I was impressed by the whole team's ability to quickly assimilate and intergrate into the unique organizational culture of the IETF and the critical role that IETF plays in the industry. Through the transition and once up and running, AMS was providing recommendations for process improvements while working hard to understand where services were most needed to make the leadership team and SDO more effective. AMS also knows how to run a very effective conference/event and makes it look easy. I highly recommend AMS to other organizations that need a skilled, professional team to provide logistics, operations and tooling services. They really understand how to work with an organization and tune their services to the cultural and business needs of the customer.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>&quot;AMS was instrumental in the transition of NANOG to an independent and self-sustaining organization. In addition, AMS' deep knowledge of the logistical and technical factors required for successful operation of an organization like NANOG is unparalleled. Finally, I was very impressed by AMS' ability to rapidly understand the culture of NANOG and thereby improve the quality and operational efficiency of the organization.&quot;</p>

              <p>&ldquo;I have been associated with AMS for more than 11 years in positions with Ameritech, AT&amp;T, and in my present position with Intel Corporation. I have found AMS to be professional, thorough and timely in the management of DSL Forum aka Broadband Forum business. AMS has demonstrated exceptional day today performance and they are always ready to go &ldquo;over and above&rdquo; to address unexpected demands.<br>
                For example, in 2003 a natural disaster occurred just weeks before one of our quarterly meetings. The DSL Forum was scheduled to host a meeting in Prague, but a flood literally crippled the city and forced us to consider cancellation of our quarterly session. Within a week of the flood, AMS had taken all necessary steps to move the venue site from Prague to London. It was completed without disruption to dates, expenses or work flow. This AMS effort amazed the Board and it is still widely discussed as a high point in our history with AMS...a major crisis was averted by AMS competency and customer focused mindset.&rdquo;</p>

        	  <p>“The IETF has used AMS services in several ways: meeting planning and support, database management including our temporary and permanent document repositories, web site and a variety of supporting tools, and the editing and publication of our final documents, the RFC Series. The services we require have stretched AMS, leading them into businesses that I'm not sure we or they expected when we first met. What has struck me over and again has been how pleasant they are to work with, how competently they perform - even if it's the first time they have done something - and how well the machinery underlying the IETF operates as a result.&quot;</p>

                “The most important advice I received when contemplating setting up Network Test Automation Forum was to hire a professional firm to help us run our forum. From that first call seeking advice on what I needed to do to start the effort, through all the steps necessary to incorporate our forum, AMS has been the constant, our beacon. AMS's counsel helped us through important steps like the creation of our policies and bylaws, their staff was able to quickly get our Web site online and they  assigned a very talented individual to serve as our Executive Director who keeps NTAF running and on track. AMS was the right decision for NTAF.”</p>

              <p>&ldquo;I've had many opportunities to work closely with AMS staff over the past decade, in a variety of MSF leadership roles. I have been consistently impressed with the professionalism, integrity, and contribution I have seen. AMS knows how to harness the initial enthusiasm, guide the formation of an efficient organization, and then work with a forum as it evolves. But what makes AMS really stand out is a consistent focus on the best interests of the Forum. AMS is not afraid to objectively support an assessment of strategic issues that can either lead to reinvention or to the closure of the forum. During my tenure on the MSF Board, and in particular as MSF President, I have consistently valued the support, guidance and insight I have received from AMS staff. I would unconditionally recommend AMS.&rdquo;</p>
