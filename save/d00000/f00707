			<h2>Better than just shared hosting.</h2>
			<p class="description">Most shared hosting platforms pack thousands of websites onto one server. But we designed the Grid differently, to be one of the web's original public clouds. Multiple servers handle every site, so the Grid has redundancy built in. That means you'll never have to fight for the resources of a single server.<br><br>

In fact, every bit of the Grid's hardware, software, and architecture was carefully designed for speed and reliability.</p>
			
			<div class="expand">
		
				<img class="close" src="http://s1.mt-cdn.net/_images/product-pages/close.svg">
			
				<p><strong>Clustered architecture.</strong> The Grid is built around shared clusters of high quality server hardware, networked together to make the most efficient use of resources.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>Up-to-date LAMP stack.</strong> The Grid features wide support for the most popular Linux server-side application technologies, including Apache, PHP, Perl, Python, & MySQL.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>Built for speed.</strong> The new and improved Grid hosting platform includes two features that help reduce page load times to the absolute minimum: PageSpeed & FastCGI. PageSpeed is an Apache module that rewrites inefficiencies in website code on the fly, using filters to optimize JavaScript, HTML, CSS stylesheets, and JPEG/PNG images. FastCGI lowers the overhead associated with interfacing the web server and CGI programs, allowing a server to handle more web page requests at once. Bottom line: your sites on the Grid now load faster than ever.</p>

				<p><strong>Grid Performance Units.</strong> Grid Performance Units (GPUs) measure the CPU time used by each request to your Grid service. Built-in reporting breaks down usage by each hit, helping you track down errors and code inefficiencies. Your Grid comes with enough GPUs to power 99% of the sites we've ever seen. If you happen to be one of the lucky ones with massive levels of sustained traffic, additional pay-as-you-go GPUs are there when you need them.</p>

						<strong class="h4">What do I get with a Grid plan?</strong>
						
						<ul>
							<li>100 GBs of premium storage</li>
							<li>1 TB of short-path bandwidth</li>
							<li>100 unique sites / alternate domains</li>
							<li>2,000 GPUs</li>
							<li>100 databases</li>
							<li>1,000 email addresses</li>
						</ul>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I use SSH to access my Grid service?</strong>
						<p>Yes. SSH access to your Grid service can be enabled on a per user account basis directly from the control panel inside the AccountCenter. Read <a href="https://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/16/#gs">this article</a> for more information.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Does my Grid come with Subversion?</strong>
						<p>Yes. Subversion is installed on the Grid. You can access your repositories remotely using "svn+ssh://" style urls. At this time repository access using "svn://" or "https://" style urls is currently not supported. For more information on "svn+ssh://" style urls, <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.6/svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html" target="_blank">see this page</a> in the subversion book. Please see our <a href="https://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/143/#gs">KnowledgeBase article</a> for more info.</p>

						<strong class="h4">Which versions of LAMP software comes with my Grid?</strong>
						<p>The Grid currently features the following versions of software:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>PHP 5<!--  (click for specific version) --></li>
							<li>Perl v5.8.4</li>
							<li>Python v2.4.4</li>
							<li>Apache 2.0.54</li>
							<li>MySQL 5.1.26</li>
						</ul>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I resell resources on my Grid service?</strong>
						<p>Yes. However, customers serious about reselling should look at our DV server. Although not specifically designed for reselling hosting services, many designers and developers routinely resell their Grid space. This solution works well for those designers and developers who typically maintain websites for their clients and only need to provide clients with email, FTP, and SSH access. You can easily create additional users that have access to email, FTP (including sub-folder FTP restrictions) and SSH resources. However, it's not designed to be a traditional mass reseller hosting platform. Therefore, it doesn't offer separate control panel access for your clients, separate website statistics for each site hosted on your Grid service, or any white label billing and customer support services for your clients. If you are interested in a more robust reseller solution, please look into our DV servers. These solutions will allow you to set resource limits for your clients and provide them with separate control panel access, in addition to many more reseller-friendly features.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Does the Grid go down for maintenance?</strong>
						<p>The Grid is designed for continuous operation 24/7/365. The distributed nature of the Grid nodes allows this system to be maintained without ever being taken offline. Should a maintenance issue arise that would require a disruption of service all efforts will be made to open a maintenance window during off-peak hours and provide all affected customers with ample advance notice.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Which applications are available for 1-Click installation?</strong>
						<p>We currently have WordPress, Drupal, and ZenCart available for 1-Click installation. More applications will be added based on customer demand. Please let us know which applications you'd like to see added to our 1-Click installer.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">If I install an application using the 1-Click installer, will it automatically be updated when new versions come out?</strong>
						<p>The current version of the 1-Click installer does not provide automatic application update capabilities. We are looking into the feasibility of adding this feature in the future.  We still encourage you to become familiar with any 1-Click application you install, so you may perform your own routine maintenance and updates as needed.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Which applications are known to run on the Grid?</strong>
						<p>For an up-to-date list of applications that have been installed on the Grid and tested for basic compatibility by (mt) Media Temple staff or customers, please see our <a href="https://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/75/#gs">KnowledgeBase article</a>. If you've successfully installed an application not already on this list or an updated version of an application, feel free to let us know. We will do our best to keep the list authoritative and current.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">If I don't see an application on the known compatibility list, does that mean it won't run on the Grid?</strong>
						<p>Absolutely not! The list of applications that are known to be compatible is for convenience only and doesn't represent a comprehensive list of applications that are capable of running on the Grid.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What are the charges if I exceed my bandwidth?</strong>
						<p>If you go over the bandwidth included with your hosting plan, you will automatically be charged for overage at the rate of $0.15 per GB. Please note: We constantly monitor the bandwidth usage of every client on our network. Once our bandwidth monitors have projected a potential overage for your hosting service, you will automatically receive an email notification containing additional details. You may also view a report of your current and projected bandwidth usage during any billing cycle directly inside the AccountCenter.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What is the AccountCenter?</strong>
						<p>The AccountCenter is (mt)'s custom all-in-one hosting control panel and account management center. It's the single source for all of your Grid controls, support requests, billing inquiries and more. The new uControl panel lets your users manage their own accounts, so you never have to change an email password or manage spam settings for your users again. Plus, the iPhone AccountCenter lets you control your hosting on the road with the world's first iPhone-enabled web hosting control panel.</p>

				<div class="faq-slide" id="faq2">
						
						<strong class="h4">Overview of the GPU measurement.</strong>
						<p>With (mt) Media Temple's Grid system, your website is no longer tied to an individual hardware server, rather it is spread across hundreds of server processors. This model gives your site ever expanding grid-cluster computing capability which allows you to scale and grow beyond the older shared server systems and even radically exceed dedicated server performance. This system is made possible by keeping track of each customer's individual usage using a system we created called GPU (which stands for Grid Performance Unit). Each Grid hosting plan includes a large number of GPUs which have been carefully calculated to provide 99.7% of all customers with enough resources to never exceed the GPU allocation. For those clients operating large scale web sites experiencing daily or infrequent traffic surges, GPUs allow you to host your websites without worrying about reaching an arbitrary limit before getting shut down.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How can I tell how many GPUs my sites use?</strong>
						<p>You can view a breakdown of your GPU statistics at any time from inside the AccountCenter. This area of the AccountCenter will allow you to see a report of your GPU usage broken down per day. If your server is projected to exceed its allocated GPU usage, a courtesy email will be sent to you automatically by our systems. The GPU system is capable of displaying hourly totals along with daily totals.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Why is the GPU based on processor core (CPU time)?</strong>
						<p>CPU time is a good representation, in general, of the overall load generated by a single Grid service. As (mt) Media Temple's GRID system develops over time, the GPU will also incorporate other measurements of system resources such as disk I/O and database activity. This will ultimately assist site owners with servers representing all types of usage characteristics, to understand their applications better and to plan for scalability.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How are GPUs calculated?</strong>
						<p>A GPU is a measurement that derives from CPU time required by every single hit/request made to your Grid service. This includes your web server activity, programs, scripts, and all associated parent and child processes across all nodes within our system (100's of processor cores). The Grid system keeps track of all the measurements taken from your server and adds them to a running total which is calculated about once an hour.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">A GPU (Grid Performance Unit) is equal to:</strong>
						
						<ul>
							<li>2,000 GPU's is equivalent to running a continuous 20% load on one processor for the month.</li>
							<li>You can use up to 2.78 GPU's per hour and not go over the 2,000 GPU limit.</li>
							<li>1 GPU = 7.24% of 1 CPU for 1 hour.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>NOTE: The above numbers are based on a 30-day calendar. These numbers will vary based on actual calendar days for each given month in your billing cycle.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What if my service exceeds the allocated GPUs?</strong>
						<p>One great aspect of the Grid: It is built to handle spikes and surges in usage. If your service grows to use 100% continuous use of a processor core, your server will effectively use 10 GPU's per hour. It is also important to note that it is unlikely that your server will have the same usage during off-peak hours as it will during high-peak hours -- so as an example, your server can effectively use 2 GPUs per hour during the day and 0.6 GPUs per hour at night. At the end of the month, you will not have exceeded the allocated amount with your plan. This is called "bursting." Based on the analysis of over 10,000 random sites, we emphatically show that the vast majority of sites (99.97%) run perfectly fine, even under serious traffic and never exceed their GPU allocation. If you should exceed your GPU allocation, you will simply be billed at the end of the month for the overage that your server incurred at the rate of $0.10 per GPU.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How are cost projections calculated?</strong>
						<p>At the beginning of each new billing period, the Grid system resets your GPU count and begins to calculate a projection of how many GPUs your server may possibly consume. When the hourly usage results multiplied by 24 (hours in the day), multiplied by 30 (days in a month) exceeds the amount of GPUs allocated in your plan, the Grid system generates an email message as a courtesy notice to you. You can also view a GPU report for your server directly inside the AccountCenter.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Is it possible for my service to be shut down because of the GPU use and overages?</strong>
						<p>Yes. We have seen a very rare number of circumstances in which some customers have reached such "severe resource demands" that their ending monthly bill would greatly exceed a majority of hosting budgets. In most of these situations, the "severe resource demands" stemmed not from organic traffic patterns and usage, but rather from malformed software, hacked scripts, or highly inefficient programming techniques. As a safety measure to the customer, it is (mt) Media Temple's policy that any Grid service consuming more than 250 GPUs per hour will be suspended until (mt) Media Temple can communicate with the customer and determine the source of overly demanding resource utilization. If you would like to pre-approve your service "bursting" past 250 GPU/hr, please contact us so we can set up an exception to this policy.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Is there a way to throttle or cap my GPU usage?</strong>
						<p>Not at this time. The Grid was designed to handle large bursts and traffic spikes. Restricting its performance is not something that was built into the design of the technology. (mt) Media Temple is, however, considering developing controls for this feature. There is currently no ETA for this feature.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">I just got this email saying that I owe $200.00 GP-something or other. Is this a bill?</strong>
						<p>That is only a projected overage. The email is letting you know that if things continue as forecasted, you will go over your allotted GPU's and have to pay for the overage.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How much am I charged for overage?</strong>
						<p>$0.10 per GPU</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What does GPU stand for and what is a GPU anyway?</strong>
						<p>GPU stands for Grid Performance Unit. You are allotted 2,000 GPU's per month. 2,000 GPU's is equivalent to running a continuous 20% load on one processor for the month.</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Based on a 30-day cycle, that allows you to run 1.38 GPU's per hour.</li>
							<li>Based on a 30-day cycle, 1 GPU = 7.24 % load on one processor for 1 hour.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<strong class="h4">Where can I see how many GPU's I'm using?</strong>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Log into your AccountCenter.</li>
							<li>Click on your primary domain.</li>
							<li>Click on GPU Usage Report.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<strong class="h4">How can I cut back my GPU usage?</strong>
						<p>Optimizing scripts, disabling plugins. View the GPU Usage Report for suggestions.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How come I'm being charged this by (mt)? My old hosting company didn't do this.</strong>
						<p>Your previous hosting environment had your site on one server. We have your site on a grid. This gives you access to more processing power than your old hosting company. 10% of a processor is actually more processing power than you would receive on a single shared server hosting environment. So, you are actually getting more power. Yet, we still have to put a cap on it. We put that cap at 20% (2,000 GPU's).</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Will I get a notice when I'm over 2,000 GPUs?</strong>
						<p>You will actually get an email before. The moment you are projected to go over, you will be sent an alert.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I get alerts every time I use "X amount" GPU's?</strong>
						<p>GPU alerts are not customizable at this time.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I throttle/cap/limit GPU usage?</strong>
						<p>You cannot throttle/cap/limit your GPU usage at this time.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I buy a bundle of GPU's ahead of time at a lower rate?</strong>
						<p>We currently do not offer GPU packages.</p>

					</div>
				
				<div class="faq-slide" id="faq4">
						
						<strong class="h4">Will my Grid come with SSL capabilities?</strong>
						<p>Yes. Your Grid service automatically comes with a shared SSL certificate that is useful for encrypted email over SSL. Please see our KnowledgeBase article for details. You may also purchase one custom SSL certificate through us for secure web browsing.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How many SSL certificates can I have associated with one Grid service?</strong>
						<p>Each Grid service can be associated with one SSL certificate. This one certificate can either be used with your primary domain name or one of your alternate domain names. If your project requires more than one SSL certificate, you can use the shared SSL certificate with either your primary domain name, access domain name, or any of your alternate domain names.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I purchase an SSL certificate from (mt) Media Temple?</strong>
						<p>Yes. We offer QuickSSL certificates (from GeoTrust), for $75 yearly. You can purchase the SSL certificate in your AccountCenter.

						<strong class="h4">What is MySQL SmartPool v.2?</strong>
						<p>It's a multi-tenant database hosting system featuring guaranteed memory resources and automatic burstability. (mt) has radically re-architected multi-tentant MySQL hosting technology, allowing the SmartPool to function more intelligently than any previous generation of hosted MySQL.</p>
						<strong class="h4">Guaranteed Memory Resources</strong>
						<p>Unlike previous generations of multi-tenant hosting technology, SmartPool v.2 guarantees each Grid customer 64MB of database memory.</p>
						<strong class="h4">One-click upgrades</strong>
						<p>When your website's traffic demands exceed the limits of the SmartPool, an upgrade to the MySQL GridContainer can be made directly inside the AccountCenter. Our system handles all aspects of the upgrade seamlessly with zero migration burdens.</p>
						<strong class="h4">Limited Resource Sharing</strong>
						<p>Rather than making everyone share and compete for resources on a single MySQL database, the SmartPool distributes users among specially designed farms of MySQL servers using virtualization technology to isolate instances from each other. This solution allows the SmartPool to achieve a low user density per MySQL instance, which minimizes resource competition and improves overall system stability.</p>
						<strong class="h4">Database Bursting</strong>
						<p>When the SmartPool recognizes sudden spikes in database traffic it automatically allocates a single-tenant MySQL Container. This allows your databases to grow beyond the guaranteed SmartPool resources. This unique feature helps customers survive temporary traffic bursts resulting from press releases, mass blog coverage, Digg, etc.</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Now with MySQL 5 NEW</li>
							<li>64MB RAM Guaranteed</li>
							<li>4GB Disk Space</li>
							<li>Guaranteed Resources</li>
							<li>Improved Stability</li>
							<li>Multiple Database Users</li>
							<li>Instantly Scalable</li>
						</ul>
						
						<strong class="h4">What is Auto-Scaling MySQL?</strong>
						<p>Auto-Scaling MySQL technology provides the behind-the-scenes power your websites need to handle intense bursts of database activity on-demand. A suite of exclusive tools developed by (mt) constantly monitor your database for bursts in activity and automatically spring into action with on-the-fly migrations to a temporary MySQL Burst Container as needed. When the burst subsides your databases are automatically migrated back to the SmartPool. Here's how it works:</p>
						<strong class="h4">Tahiti Load-Leveling Technology</strong>
						<p>The constant monitoring of the Tahiti load-leveling system identifies overloaded databases within the MySQL SmartPool and prepares them for scaling.</p>
						<strong class="h4">Transparent Database Migration</strong>
						<p>Your database is backed up and duplicated into a dedicated MySQL Burst Container invisibly as your website continues to operate.</p>
						<strong class="h4">Smooth Scaling</strong>
						<p>After the initial duplication is complete, a friendly scaling message is displayed in place of your website as an additional sync is applied to ensure no data loss. This usually takes less than 5 minutes.</p>
						<strong class="h4">Bursting Complete</strong>
						<p>An email is sent notifying you that your database is now serving data from your temporary Container until the high load subsides (up to 7 days).</p>
						<strong class="h4">Zero-Intervention Database Scalability</strong>
						<p>Our MySQL SmartPool system automatically identifies intense bursts of database activity and transports your databases into a MySQL Burst Container. This proprietary system delivers a dedicated instance of MySQL with the isolated resources your applications demand during traffic spikes.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How many database users comes with my Grid service?</strong>
						<p>Each Grid service is deployed with a single database user capable of creating up to 100 databases. Each Grid service in the SmartPool system can then create up to 4 more MySQL users, bringing the total to 5. Permissions which include database access, read only and read/write capabilities, can be set on a per user, per database level. If more users are required, this can be changed by purchasing a MySQL GridContainer. The MySQL GridContainer Lite comes with 10 MySQL users, Pro includes 20 users, and Advanced supports up to 50 users. Permissions can be set on a per user, per database level. Privileges include database access, read capability and read/write capabilities.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I access my databases from external applications?</strong>
						<p>Yes. Each Grid service comes with a unique address that will allow you to access your databases from outside the (mt) Media Temple network. For your protection, you will need to add the IP addresses you will be connecting from before you can gain external access. Please see the "Database" section of the "Server Guide" from more information. Detailed instructions are available in our KnowledgeBase article.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How much storage is available for my MySQL database in the SmartPool v.2?</strong>
						<p>There is a 4GB limit on total database size. If you burst beyond this, then you will be put into the appropriate sized MySQL GridContainer. Customers have the option to purchase a separate MySQL GridContainer to provide additional database storage. Please visit the MySQL GridContainer product page for details.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What is a MySQL Burst Container?</strong>
						<p>A MySQL Burst Container is a single-tenant MySQL GridContainer that is allocated to you automatically in real-time when the SmartPool system recognizes sudden spikes in database traffic. This solution allows your databases to scale beyond the guaranteed SmartPool resources. This unique feature helps you survive temporary traffic bursts resulting from press releases, mass blog coverage, DIGG, etc.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Do MySQL Burst Containers cost extra?</strong>
						<p>No. MySQL Burst Containers are an automatic no-cost part of our MySQL SmartPool v.2.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How long will I have access to a MySQL Burst Container?</strong>
						<p>You will have access to your MySQL Burst Container for up to three full days.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What happens after three days?</strong>
						<p>The SmartPool will analyze your MySQL usage patterns and send you an email with additional MySQL options that are available.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">During peak usage, will (mt) shut down my instance of MySQL for my website?</strong>
						<p>No. Please note: It is possible for your resource usage to exceed the limitations of your Burst Container. The limits of this container far exceed traditional shared hosting and are comparable to hosting products costing three times the price of your Grid service.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How many times will I be able to temporarily scale using a MySQL Burst Container?</strong>
						<p>Each Grid plan comes with two MySQL Burst Container cycles each month. If you exceed two in any month, you will receive an email notification containing additional options.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How can I purchase a permanent MySQL GridContainer?</strong>
						<p>Permanent MySQL GridContainers can be purchased and instantly activated 24/7 from inside your AccountCenter. Please visit our MySQL GridContainer product page for more details and available options.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Where can I find more MySQL Container FAQs?</strong>
						<p>Please visit our MySQL GridContainer FAQ page.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How many databases can I have on the SmartPool v.2?</strong>
						<p>Each Grid service can have up to 100 databases using the SmartPool v.2 system. Please keep in mind that there is a limitation in the number of database tables each Grid can have in total. There is a maximum allowable limit of 10,000 database tables. The main reason for this limitation is to protect against abuse -- most applications that use a database don't even approach these limits under normal circumstances.</p>
						
					</div>
					
					<div class="faq-slide" id="faq6">
						
						<strong class="h4">What is the difference between the MySQL GridContainer and the MySQL SmartPool v.2?</strong>
						<p>The new MySQL GridContainer is designed for customers who demand guaranteed performance and absolute reliability for their hosted database systems. Past versions of MySQL, much like MySQL SmartPool v.2 system, work well for a majority of applications but unfortunately remain subject to the unavoidable volatility of shared hosting, sometimes called the "bad neighbor effect." The MySQL GridContainer system solves past problems with a next generation system that runs a single instance of MySQL in a dedicated server which has complete RAM and CPU isolation from other applications, databases, and customers. This new, industry-first architecture results in faster performing sites with a narrowed scope of administration for optimizing and troubleshooting database driven applications.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How do I know what size MySQL GridContainer I'll need?</strong>
						<p>The GridContainer size you choose depends on how your web applications use the MySQL database server. The GridContainer Lite is an excellent entry level, business grade solution that offers a highly tuned MySQL environment with additional tools to help you analyze your database utilization and understand your scalability needs. Once you've purchased a GridContainer Lite, all upgrades and downgrades between other container sizes can automatically be managed from the AccountCenter.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Does the Grid include a free MySQL GridContainer?</strong>
						<p>The Grid doesn't include a free MySQL GridContainer. However, the Grid does come with all the MySQL capabilities provided by our recently re-architected MySQL SmartPool v.2 system. For the majority of Grid customers, the MySQL SmartPool v.2 system is an adequate solution. Those interested in higher performance, business grade MySQL hosting may purchase a MySQL GridContainer for an additional monthly fee.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Is there downtime when upgrading between GridContainer sizes?</strong>
						<p>Acquiring additional GridContainer resources is a simple, automated upgrade from within theAccountCenter. Resource increases happen in real-time with zero disruption or downtime for your applications.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How do I manage my GridContainer environment &amp; applications?</strong>
						<p>We've developed our own set of time-saving GUI tools to help you manage the setup and routine maintenance of your MySQL GridContainer. All the existing database management tools inside the AccountCenter work the same as before with your MySQL GridContainer. These tools feature quick access to the most commonly used database operations. phpMyAdmin is also available for additional web-based database control. In addition, new exclusive MySQL GridContainer controls allow you to reboot your container environment, quickly repair database tables, and provide access to MySQL performance and query analysis tools on demand. Additional tools for enhanced, monitoring, and customization will continue to be added to the MySQL GridContainer controls in the future.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Will I have root access to MySQL?</strong>
						<p>While root-level access is not available on the Grid, you can edit the my.cnf file through the MySQL GridContainer controls in the AccountCenter. Most options are fully configurable. There is a convenient reset option if you want to return to the default configuration. You will not be able to effectively set certain parameters beyond the resources you have purchased with your container. For example, key_buffer_size cannot be set to allow use of more than your purchased RAM. Despite this, a great deal of customization is possible.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Which version of MySQL does the GridContainer come with?</strong>
						<p>All MySQL GridContainers include MySQL Server version 5.1.26.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Is the MySQL GridContainer solution a clustered or replicated database solution?</strong>
						<p>The current implementation of the MySQL GridContainers provides a single unshared copy of the MySQL Server. No clustering or replication functionality is included. We are looking into the possibility offering this functionality in the future.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">I have an existing Grid account, how will the new containers affect me?</strong>
						<p>Along with the new MySQL GridContainers, our MySQL SmartPool v.2 system has been completely re-architected for increased performance and stability. Please visit the MySQL SmartPool v.2 page for more details.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How do MySQL GridContainers stack up to other MySQL hosting solutions?</strong>
						<p>MySQL GridContainers provide a scalable, resource isolated environment specifically tuned for maximum MySQL Server performance. Containers feature many of the benefits of a dedicated or virtual dedicated sever without any of the setup, maintenance burdens or costs usually associated with dedicated server solutions.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What MySQL GridContainer sizes are available?</strong>
						<p>MySQL GridContainers are currently available in the three sizes shown below. All GridContainers can be ordered from the AccountCenter and rapidly provisioned for use in minutes! Once you've purchased a GridContainer, all upgrades and downgrades between container sizes can be controlled automatically from the AccountCenter.</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Lite: 128 MBs</li>
							<li>Pro: 256 MBs</li>
							<li>Advanced: 512 MBs</li>
						</ul>
						
						<strong class="h4">What are the prices for MySQL GridContainers?</strong>
						<p>The 128MB GridContainer is an additional $20 per month, the 256MB GridContainer is an additional $75 per month, and the 512MB GridContainer is an additional $150 per month.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Where can I sign up for the MySQL GridContainer?</strong>
						<p>In order to purchase a MySQL GridContainer, you will need to already have a Grid account. To purchase a new MySQL GridContainer, simply log into your AccountCenter and click on the GridContainer icon to sign up.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How can I tell how my applications are using MySQL database resources?</strong>
						<p>There are many different methods to help determine how your applications utilize database resources. MySQL GridContainers include specialized tools and documentation to aide in this process. For complete details on these tools, please visit the MySQL GridContainer controls in the AccountCenter.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Can I edit any MySQL configuration options?</strong>
						<p>In the current version of our MySQL GridContainer technology, server-level configuration editing is not available. We are currently looking into the possibility of making this feature available in the future along with root-level MySQL access. Although these features are on the product roadmap, availability dates have not be determined.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Is MySQL 5.x available to use within the GridContainer?</strong>
						<p>Currently, only MySQL 5.1.26 is available. In the future, we plan on making multiple versions of MySQL Server available inside our GridContainers along with the possibility of version switching. Although these features are on the product roadmap, availability dates have not be determined.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How many MySQL user accounts does a GridContainer come with?</strong>
						<p>The MySQL GridContainer Lite comes with 10 MySQL users, Pro includes 20 users and Advanced supports up to 50 users. Permissions can be set on a per user, per database level. Privileges include database access, read capability, and read/write capabilities.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">Why does the Grid use containers?</strong>
						<p>Server software, including MySQL, perform best when dedicated resources are allocated to them. (mt) Media Temple has recognized this trend and developed proprietary GridContainer technology to provide high performance, resource isolated environments specially designed for hosting this class of software.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How do I manage my GridContainer environment &amp; applications?</strong>
						<p>GridContainers have been designed with a unique balance between maximum flexibility and minimum maintenance. To achieve this goal, we've developed our own set of time saving GUI and command-line tools to help you manage the setup, deployment, and routine maintenance of the software running inside your container. Please read the documentation for the MySQL GridContainer for details on available tools.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How do GridContainers stack up to other hosting solutions?</strong>
						<p>GridContainers provide a scalable, resource isolated environment, optimized to perform a specialized hosting function. Containers feature many of the benefits of a dedicated or virtual dedicated sever without any of the setup, optimization, maintenance burdens or costs usually associated with dedicated server solutions.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">What if my applications outgrow my GridContainer?</strong>
						<p>GridContainers allow you to instantly scale your applications without hassle! When you're ready, all you'll have to do is upgrade to the next larger GridContainer. Container upgrades are automated and happen instantly 24/7 through the AccountCenter! When it's time to upgrade, you won't even have to make changes to your application.</p>
						
						<strong class="h4">How much disk space is included with each MySQL GridContainer?</strong>
						<p>The MySQL GridContainer Lite includes 4GB of storage, Pro has 6GB, and Advanced has 8GB of storage. This is the only storage space available to your MySQL GridContainer and does not count against the disk space included with your Grid plan.</p>
