<h3>Definitions of States</h3>
<ul>
<LI><B>EDIT</b> = Awaiting editing or being edited
<li><b>RFC-EDITOR</b> = Undergoing final internal review before AUTH48
<li><b>AUTH48</b> = Awaiting final author approval
<li><b>AUTH48-DONE</b> = Final approvals are complete
<li><b>AUTH</b> = Awaiting author action
<li><b>IESG</b> = Awaiting IESG action
<li><b>IANA</b> = Document has been edited, but is holding for completion of IANA actions
<li><b>REF</b> = Document has been edited, but is holding for a normative
  reference that is in the queue
<br>(Note: In addition, "REF" is used to mark a list of normative references shown
  on the queue page. Each reference is listed as IN-QUEUE or NOT-RECEIVED.)
<li><b>MISSREF</b> = Awaiting a missing normative reference (i.e., the reference is
  NOT-RECEIVED). See below regarding MISSREF generation numbers.
</ul>

<h3>Definitions of Flags</h3>
<p>A document can move through various states, while having either, both, or no
  flags set.
<ul>
<li><b>*A</b> = IANA flag. The document has IANA actions that are not yet completed.
<li><b>*R</b> = Reference flag. The document has one or more normative references that are IN-QUEUE or NOT-RECEIVED.
</ul>

<h3>Definitions of MISSREF Generation Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>1G</b> = has a reference to a NOT-RECEIVED document
<li><b>2G</b> = has a reference to a document that references a NOT-RECEIVED document
<li><b>3G</b> = has a reference to a document that references a doc that references a NOT-RECEIVED document
</ul>

<h3>States That Are No Longer in Use</h3>
<i>As of March 2013, documents under review by the Independent Submissions Editor are tracked in
the Datatracker.</i>
<ul>
<li><b>ISR</b> = Independent Submission Review by the ISE
<li><b>ISR-AUTH</b> = Independent submission awaiting author action, or in
  discussion between author and ISE
<li><b>TO</b> = Time-out period during which the IESG performs a review as described
  in <a href="/bcp/bcp92.txt">BCP 92</a> (TO is listed with an expiration date on the queue page.)
</ul>
