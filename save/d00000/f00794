      <p>We have published our <a href="http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/documents/Budget2007.pdf"> 2007 budget</a>. The budget is
           based on the funds available at the beginning of the year. We were hoping to set our budget at $211,000, which represents a 10% 
           increase from last year's spending. But, we want to stay conservative, and watch how our fundraising efforts go this year.
           We have set our 2007 fundraising goal to $250,000. Part of this funding will help offset the loss from last year.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is pleased to present its December <a href="/press/2006Dec-newsletter">newsletter</a>.
           Please take a few minutes to read what we have been up to for the last 6 months.</p>
      <p>We are working to upgrade the project's network testbed with 10Gigabit interconnects. Cisco has
         generously donated a 10Gigabit switch and we have received network adapters from Myricom, Neterion,
         Intel, and Chelsio. Adapters from other vendors are being solicited so that we can do interoperability
         testing.</p>
      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation has negotiated a joint technology development
         agreement with NLNet and the University of Zagreb to develop virtualized
         network stack support for FreeBSD.  With the generous sponsorship of
         NLNet, the FreeBSD Foundation has contracted Marko Zec at the University
         of Zagreb with the goal of producing a prototype implementation on
         FreeBSD 7-CURRENT in early 2007.</p>
       <p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to the FreeBSD Foundation in 2006! We raised a total of $100,714. Plus, we also received
         commitments totalling $45,000 towards this fundraiser. The funds will be received in 2007, so these donations will 
         count towards our 2007 fundraising numbers. Once we have created our 2007 budget, we will create a new 2007 fundraising 
         meter. We've already received
         over $1200 in donations for 2007! Please consider donating for 2007 now, to help us meet our budget for this year.

         by January 26, 2007. Applications will not be accepted after this date.</p>
         <p>Though we would like to support everyone who applies, priority will be given to FreeBSD developers 
         speaking at the conference. Due to constrained resources, we would appreciate if developers could
         look to their employers first for sponsorship or cost-splitting.</p>

      <h2>May, 2006: BSDCan</h2>

 	<p>The Foundation was a proud sponsor of BSDCan 2006. Three members of the Foundation
       attended the conference this year in Ottawa, Ontario. This was the first time we had a table or booth
       at a conference. We appreciate all of the developers who stopped by to introduce themselves. It was great being able to
       put faces with names. And, it gave us a chance to talk about how we can help the FreeBSD project and community.
       Many people contributed to our donation jar and we received almost $600 USD in donations. Plus we
       received a commitment (which we have since received) from Yahoo! to donate a system for our Java amd64 project.</p>

      <h2>March/April, 2006: Java Release, Coverity License Agreement</h2>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation is proud to announce the availability of <a href="/java/">certified
       Java 1.5 JDK and JRE binaries</a> for FreeBSD 5.4 and 6.0! This is an example of how
       committed we are to supporting projects that enhance the FreeBSD
       operating system. Read our <a href="/press/20060405-PRrelease">press release</a> for more information. Also, check
       out Dru Lavigne's <a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/unix/bsd/archives/008670.asp"> interview</a> with
       FreeBSD Foundation's Deb Goodkin.
      <p>We are continuing

       added support for the amd64/em64t hardware platform.</p>

      <p>The FreeBSD Foundation and Coverity, Inc., are pleased to announce the
       licensing of the Coverity Prevent&#8482; static analysis software for use by
       the FreeBSD Project.  The Prevent analysis tool provides for static C
       source code analysis, finding common patterns of source code bug, including
       bugs leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities.  This agreement follows
       on the footsteps of a 12-month trial project applying the Coverity Prevent
       software to the FreeBSD kernel source code, and allows perpetual use and
       customization of the Prevent tool by the FreeBSD Project.  Since the FreeBSD
       Foundation brought their FreeBSD Project's Prevent server online in
       mid-January, 90 kernel developers have registered to use the service,
       committing hundreds of bug fixes, many present in the upcoming FreeBSD 6.1
       release, and will be expanding the application of the tool to cover additional
       system components.</p>

       Developer Summit, held June 10-11, 2003, in San Antonio
       Texas.  The summit brought together many of FreeBSD's
       key developers to discuss the FreeBSD 5.x development
       branch, as well as tentative plans for the future 6.x
       development branch.  Many additional developers were able
       to participate by phone, webcast, and IRC.</p>

    <h2>FreeBSD Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font>
       Development Resources</h2>

    <p>The global team of developers working toward a fully
       compliant FreeBSD Java port needed a central server to hold
       the source code repository.  In September and October,
       2002, the FreeBSD Foundation located donors for the
       necessary hardware, rack space, and network connectivity.
       The system is now fully deployed and is in use by the
       FreeBSD Java team.</p>

    <p>The FreeBSD Foundation co-sponsored the third FreeBSD
      Developer Summit, held June 11-12, 2002 in Monterey,
      California.  The Summit brought together more than 20
      FreeBSD developers to discuss the key architectural
      elements of current FreeBSD development.  Many additional
      developers were able to participate by phone, webcast, and IRC.

    <h2>FreeBSD Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font>
      Development Kit License</h2>

    <p>In August, 2001, the Foundation initiated negotiations
       with Sun Microsystems to license a FreeBSD version of
       Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK)<font
       size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> and Java Runtime Environment
       (JRE)<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font>.  Discussions
       with Sun continued into December.  Thanks to the dedicated
       efforts of the two parties, the license agreement was
       finalized in early December, 2001.  The FreeBSD versions of the
       JDK and JRE are now undergoing the arduous technology
       compliance testing required by Sun.  They will be made
       publicly available as soon as they have been certified 100%
       Java compliant.</p>

    <p>The licensing of the Java Development Kit is a good example
       of one kind of project for which the support of the
       Foundation is ideal.  The license agreement is a contract,
       and it can only be executed by a legally recognized entity
       such as an individual or a corporation.  As an informal
       confederation of individuals, the FreeBSD Project itself
       has no legal standing.  To execute contracts it needs a
       legal entity, and the FreeBSD Foundation fills that role.</p>

    <p>The availability of a FreeBSD JDK license will benefit
       both the users and the developers of FreeBSD.  As Java
       continues to grow in popularity, more and more software
       packages require it.  With an officially licensed Java
       Development Kit, FreeBSD will gain better acceptance as
       the right choice of operating system for Java-based
       projects.</p>

    <h2>Stateful Filtering Extensions for IPFW</h2>

    <p>Prior to the creation of the FreeBSD Foundation its
       predecessor, FreeBSD, Inc., contracted with Luigi Rizzo
       to enhance FreeBSD's packet filtering facility with a
       stateful filtering feature.  This was an oft-requested
       feature to enhance FreeBSD's ability to serve as an
       effective and flexible network firewall.  The Foundation
       elected to assume responsibility for funding this contract.
       Under this arrangement, Luigi added the stateful filtering
       feature to the FreeBSD operating system early in 2000.
       Since then he has made ongoing enhancements to the code.
