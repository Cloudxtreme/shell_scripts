				<p>Welcome to the Electric Sheep Fencing website. We are the leading provider of custom FreeBSD-based network security appliance solutions, as well as the official commercial support provider of the open source firewall <a href="http://www.pfsense.org" target="_blank">pfSense</a>, providing support, consulting and development services to a worldwide customer base.</p>
				<p>A barrier to choosing and implementing open source software is the availability of prompt, professional support from knowledgable individuals. We eliminate that barrier for pfSense users.</p>
				<p>We offer support contracts, as well as related consulting and custom development services.</p>
				<p>We also have created and maintain dozens of custom branded network security appliances for OEMs in hospitality, networking, security, industrial control systems, and other industries.</p>

				<h3>Support Services</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Electric Sheep Fencing offers commercial support for pfSense and m0n0wall to a worldwide customer base.</p>
					<h4>Support Benefits</h4>
					<p>Support subscribers receive a number of benefits not afforded to other users of the open source projects.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Guaranteed prompt, professional, personal attention to all questions and support issues. Typical response time under 3 hours for questions submitted between 8:00 AM and midnight US Eastern time, with immediate accessibility 24/7/365 via phone support.</li>
						<li>Ability to get detailed documentation on a specific feature or area upon request.</li>
						<li>Fast bug fixes for most problems you encounter. (some may be time consuming to resolve)</li>
						<li>Significantly more input on future direction of the project - though we cannot make any promises that a specific request will be fulfilled, feature requests from customers receive much higher priority.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Support Packages</h4>
					<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://portal.pfsense.org/index.php/support-subscription">Support Subscription</a> on the pfSense Portal.</p>

				<h3>Consulting Services</h3>
				<div>
					<p>We offer the following professional services and more as part of the <a href="https://portal.pfsense.org/index.php/subscribe-for-access">pfSense Subscriptions</a> available on the pfSense portal.</p>
					<p><strong>Firewall Ruleset Reviews</strong></p>
					<p>Is your firewall ruleset configured for optimal security in your environment? An outside assessment by a professional with years of firewall configuration and auditing experience is an easy, low cost way to obtain recommendations for improving your security posture. This service is not limited to m0n0wall and pfSense firewalls, our professionals are experienced with Cisco routers, PIX and ASA firewalls, Microsoft ISA Server, Check Point, and Sonicwall, amongst many other vendors.</p>
					<p><strong>Vulnerability Assessment</strong></p><p>A more recognizable term for many people is "penetration testing." Though penetration testing is different from vulnerability assessments it's often incorrectly marketed as penetration testing because of the recognition of that term. A vulnerability assessment is well defined on Wikipedia as "the process of identifying and quantifying vulnerabilities in a system." The scope of such testing varies from one engagement to another, but most commonly it involves assessing all perimeter Internet-accessible hosts on an organization's network (at a minimum).</p>
					<p><strong>Network Design</strong></p>
					<p>A secure network infrastructure starts with a sound network design. Whether you have an existing network or are in the process of planning a new network, we can assist with the design of your infrastructure. We specialize in network perimeters, but possess the expertise to assist in most all network environments.</p>
				</div>
				<!-- consulting services -->
				<h3>Development Services</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Electric Sheep Fencing develops solutions for customers, usually extending upon the base features of m0n0wall or pfSense, or customizing an existing feature. We encourage project sponsors to permit us to release the code under the BSD license as part of the project, however we also develop proprietary code/features (at a higher cost). </p><p>We employ only developers with commit access to m0n0wall and/or pfSense, because we are familiar with their work and they are familiar with the existing code base. This compensation also helps keep our developers motivated to continue working on the open source projects on a volunteer basis. </p><p>If you have a development project in mind, get in touch with us. Costs will vary greatly depending on the amount of effort required, whether or not we can open source the resultant work, and how much interest it is to the open source community as a whole. Contact <a href="mailto:cmb@electricsheepfencing.com">Chris Buechler</a> to discuss your specific project. </p>
