    greater than the individual pieces. Working with the community is
    continually a pleasure, and only enhances our ability to creatively 
    develop our products. KACE continues to recognize the importance of
    the community through our enthusiastic support, and as we grow, we
    hope to develop more community members and participate in ways that

    just getting into open source software, or any of the thousands of other
    "real world" roles it plays.

    Developers that choose to colocate their servers with us also choose 
    to install FreeBSD on their dedicated servers. The open source nature 
    of the BSD license gives them the flexibility they need to develop 
    innovative software. Plus, they have access to an enterprise level 
    operating system that is free, has an active development community, 
    and which lets them contribute their own skills to make the system 
    better for their own development. We have asked several clients why 
    they decided to use FreeBSD and the answer has always been the same: 
    the cost and networking ability of the operating system rivals its 
    commercial license competitors.

      <h3>LETTER FROM THE BOARD</h3>

      <p>Dear Visitor,</p>
  
      <p>Welcome to the FreeBSD Foundation's website!</p>
  
      <p>
        Since our founding in 2000, the FreeBSD Foundation
        has played a growing role in supporting the FreeBSD
        Project and community.  Here you'll find information
        about all our recent activities.  From managing
        intellectual property issues and funding development
        projects, to supporting technical conferences and
        developer collaboration, we've been very busy.  I
        encourage you take a few minutes to browse our
        website and learn more about what we do.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        As a 501(c)3 charity, all of our work is funded by
        donations.  We believe strongly that the community
        we serve and those who trust us with their donations
        deserve insight into how we manage our finances.
        For this reason, our books are published quarterly
        and can be reviewed in the financial section of our
        website.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This year marks a significant milestone for the FreeBSD
        Foundation.  Based on the success of our 2012 fundraising
        campaign, we have posted our first
        <a href=documents/Budget2013.pdf> $1,000,000 budget</a>.
        Our financial strength has allowed us to hire
        technical staff, almost triple our funded development
        spending, and to invest in the critical infrastructure
        needed by the FreeBSD community to build, develop,
        test, and distribute FreeBSD to millions of users.
        Our growing capabilities, all made possible by your
        generous donations, are proof that the FreeBSD
        Foundation will be a faithful supporter of FreeBSD
        for decades to come.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We hope to continue our growth in the years to come,
        but that will only be possible through continued
        public support.  I hope you not only benefit from
        our work, but find it compelling enough to consider
        sending us a donation.
      </p>
  
      <p>Enjoy the site!</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>
        Justin T. Gibbs<br />
        President<br />
