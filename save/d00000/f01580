cryptlib consists of a set of layered security services and associated
programming interfaces that provide an integrated set of information and
communications security capabilities. Much like the network reference model,
cryptlib contains a series of layers that provide each level of abstraction,
with higher layers building on the capabilities provided by the lower
layers.

At the lowest level are basic components such as core encryption and
authentication routines, which are usually implemented in software but may
also be implemented in hardware (due to the speed of the software components
used in cryptlib, the software is usually faster than dedicated hardware). At
the next level are components that wrap up the specialised and often quite
complex core components in a layer that provides abstract functionality and
ensures complete cross-platform portability of data. These functions typically
cover areas such as "create a digital signature" or "exchange an encryption
key". At the highest level are extremely powerful and easyto- use functions
such as "encrypt a message", "sign a message", "open a secure link", and
"create a digital certificate" that require no knowledge of encryption
techniques, and that take care of complex issues such as key management, data
encoding, en/decryption, and digital signature processing.

cryptlib's powerful object management interface provides the ability to add
encryption and authentication capabilities to an application without needing
to know all the low-level details that make the encryption or authentication
work. The automatic object-management routines take care of encoding issues
and crossplatform portability problems, so that a handful of function calls is
all that's needed to wrap up data in signed or encrypted form with all of the
associated information and parameters needed to recreate it on the other side
of a communications channel. This provides a considerable advantage over other
encryption toolkits that often require hundreds of lines of code and the
manipulation of complex encryption data structures to perform the same
task.

The software has been developed outside the US and is therefore not covered by
US export restrictions and can be used anywhere in the world.
