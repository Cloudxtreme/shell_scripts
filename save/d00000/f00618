          System: A Non-Technical Explanation&nbsp;&#150; Why Universal Resolvability 
          Is Important</font></h3>
        <p><b>What is the Domain Name 
          System?</b></p>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) 
          helps users to find their way around the Internet. Every computer on 
          the Internet has a unique address &#150; just like a telephone number 
          &#150; which is a rather complicated string of numbers. It is called 
          its &quot;IP address&quot; (IP stands for &quot;Internet Protocol&quot;). 
          </p>
        <p>But it is hard to remember 
          everyone's IP address. The DNS makes it easier by allowing a familiar 
          string of letters (the &quot;domain name&quot;) to be used instead of 
          the arcane IP address. So instead of typing 192.0.34.65, you can type 
          <a href="http://www.icann.org/">www.icann.org</a>. It is a &quot;mnemonic&quot; 
          device that makes addresses easier to remember.</p>
        <p>Translating the name into 
          the IP address is called &quot;resolving the domain name.&quot; The 
          goal of the DNS is for any Internet user any place in the world to reach 
          a specific website IP address by entering its domain name. Domain names 
          are also used for reaching e-mail addresses and for other Internet applications. 
          </p>
        <p><b>What is universal resolvability 
          and why is it important to users?</b></p>
        <p>Think of the phone system&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
          when you dial a number, it rings at a particular location because there 
          is a central numbering plan that ensures that each telephone number 
          is unique. The DNS works in a similar way. If telephone numbers or domain 
          names were not globally unique, phone calls or e-mail intended for one 
          person might go to someone else with the same number or domain name. 
          Without uniqueness, both systems would be unpredictable and therefore 
          unreliable. </p>
        <p>Ensuring predictable results 
          from any place on the Internet is called &quot;universal resolvability.&quot; 
          It is a critical design feature of the DNS, one that makes the Internet 
          the helpful, global resource that it is today. Without it, the same 
          domain name might map to different Internet locations under different 
          circumstances, which would only cause confusion.</p>
        <p>When you send an e-mail to 
          your Aunt Sally, do you care who receives it?</p>
        <p>Do you care if it goes to 
          your Uncle Juan instead? Wait a minute&#133;do you have an Uncle Juan? 
          Then whose Uncle Juan received it? Do you care if it reaches Aunt Sally 
          if you send it from work but my Uncle Juan if you send it from home? 
          </p>
        <p>Of course you care who receives 
          it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's why you wrote it in the first place. 
          Whether you're doing business or sending personal correspondence, you 
          want to be certain that your message gets to the intended addressee.</p>
        <p>If at any point the DNS must 
          make a choice between two identical domain names with different IP addresses, 
          the DNS would not function. It would not know how to resolve the domain 
          name. When a DNS computer queries another computer and asks, &quot;are 
          you the intended recipient of this message?&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; and 
          &quot;no&quot; are acceptable answers, but &quot;maybe&quot; is not. 
          </p>
        <p><b>Where does ICANN come 
          in?</b></p>
        <p>This is where ICANN comes 
          in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ICANN is responsible for managing and coordinating 
          the DNS to ensure universal resolvability.</p>
        <p>ICANN is the global, non-profit, 
          private-sector coordinating body acting in the public interest. ICANN 
          ensures that the DNS continues to function effectively&nbsp;&#150; by 
          overseeing the distribution of unique numeric IP addresses and domain 
          names. Among its other responsibilities, ICANN oversees the processes 
          and systems that ensure that each domain name maps to the correct IP 
          address.</p>
        <p><b>What goes on behind the 
          scenes?</b></p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, the story 
          becomes a little more complicated.</p>
        <p>In an Internet address &#150; 
          such as icann.org &#150; the .org part is known as a Top Level Domain, 
          or TLD. So-called &quot;TLD registry&quot; organizations house online 
          databases that contain information about the domain names in that TLD. 
          The .org registry database, for example, contains the Internet whereabouts 
          &#150; or IP address &#150; of icann.org. So in trying to find the Internet 
          address of icann.org your computer must first find the .org registry 
          database. How is this done?</p>
        <p>At the heart of the DNS are 
          13 special computers, called root servers. They are coordinated by ICANN 
          and are distributed around the world. All 13 contain the same vital 
          information &#150; this is to spread the workload and back each other 
          up. </p>
        <p>Why are these root servers 
          so important? The root servers contain the IP addresses of all the TLD 
          registries &#150; both the global registries such as .com, .org, etc. 
          and the 244 country-specific registries such as .fr (France), .cn (China), 
          etc. This is critical information. If the information is not 100% correct 
          or if it is ambiguous, it might not be possible to locate a key registry 
          on the Internet. In DNS parlance, the information must be unique and 
          authentic. Let us look at how this information is used.</p>
        <p>Scattered across the Internet 
          are thousands of computers &#150; called &quot;Domain Name Resolvers&quot; 
          or just plain &quot;resolvers&quot; - that routinely cache the 
          information they receive from queries to the root servers. 
          These resolvers are located strategically with Internet Service Providers 
          (ISPs) or institutional networks. They are used to respond to a user's 
          request to resolve a domain name &#150; that is, to find the corresponding 
          IP address.</p>
        <p>So what happens to a user's 
          request to reach our familiar friend at icann.org? The request is forwarded 
          to a local resolver. The resolver splits the request into its component 
          parts. It knows where to find the .org registry &#150; remember, it 
          had copied that information from a root server beforehand &#150; so 
          it forwards the request over to the .org registry to find the IP address 
          of icann.org. This answer is forwarded back to the user's computer. 
          And we're done. It's that simple! The domain name icann.org has been 
          &quot;resolved&quot;!</p>
        <p>Why do we need the resolvers? 
          Why not use the root servers directly? After all, they contain essentially 
          the same information. The answer is for reasons of performance. The 
          root servers could not handle hundreds of billions of requests a day! 
          It would slow users down.</p>
        <p>If you are still with the 
          story, you are already wondering about more complicated names with more 
          parts such as www.icann.org. Well, the DNS is a hierarchical system. 
          First, the resolver finds the IP address for the .org registry, queries 
          that registry to find the IP address for icann.org, then queries a local 
          computer at that address to find the final IP address for www.icann.org. 
          Just what you would expect. </p>
        <p>It is important to remember 
          the central and critical role played by the root servers that store 
          information about the unique, authoritative root. Confusion would result 
          if there were two TLDs with the same name: which one did the user intend? 
          The beauty of the Internet architecture is that it ensures there is 
          a unique, authoritative root, so that there is no chance of ambiguity.</p>
        <p><b>What about &quot;alternate 
          roots?&quot; How do they fit into this picture?</b></p>
        <p>Anyone can create a root 
          system similar to the unique authoritative root managed by ICANN. Many 
          people and entities have. Some of these are purely private (inside a 
          single corporation, for example) and are insulated from having any effect 
          on the DNS. Some, however, overlap the authoritative global DNS root 
          by incorporating the unique, authoritative root information, and then 
          adding new pseudo-TLDs that have not resulted from the consensus-driven 
          process by which official new TLDs are created through ICANN. The alternate 
          root operators persuade some users to have their resolvers &quot;point&quot; 
          to their alternate root instead of the authoritative root. Others (New.net 
          is a recent example) also create browser plug-ins and other software 
          workarounds to accomplish similar effects. The one uniform fact about 
          all these efforts is that these pseudo-TLDs are not included in the 
          authoritative root managed by ICANN and, thus, are not resolvable by 
          the vast majority of Internet users.</p>
        <p><b>Why do alternate roots 
          create a problem?</b></p>
        <p>There are many potential 
          problems caused by these unofficial, alternate root efforts to exploit 
          the stability and reach of the authoritative root. These efforts are 
          often promoted by those unwilling to abide by the consensus policies 
          established by the Internet community, policies designed to ensure the 
          continued stability and utility of the DNS.</p>
        <p>For example: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, the names of some 
            of these pseudo-TLDs could overlap TLD names in the authoritative 
            root or those that appear in other alternate roots. Our familiar friend 
            icann.org could appear in two different roots. Your e-mail to Aunt 
            Sally could end up with my Uncle Juan.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Second, the unknowing 
            users might not be linked to one of these alternate roots and not 
            be able to reach these pseudo-TLD addresses at all. Your e-mail to 
            Aunt Sally could end up as a dead-letter.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Third, those purchasing 
            domain names in these pseudo-TLDs may not be aware of these and other 
            consequences of the lack of universal resolvability. Or they may be 
            under the impression that they are experiencing universal resolvability 
            when in fact they are not. They may be very upset to learn that the 
            names they registered are also being used by others, or that a new 
            TLD in the authoritative root will not include those names.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These problems are not significant 
          so long as these alternate roots remain very small, that is, house few 
          domain names with little potential for conflict. But if they should 
          ever attract many users, the problems would become much more serious, 
          and could affect the stability and reliability of the DNS itself. Users 
          would lose confidence in the utility of the Internet.</p>
        <p><b>What is ICANN's role?</b></p>
        <p>ICANN's mission is to protect 
          and preserve the stability, integrity and utility &#150; on behalf of 
          the global Internet community &#150; of the DNS and the authoritative 
          root ICANN was established to manage. ICANN has no role to play with 
          alternate roots so long as these and other analogous efforts do not 
          create instabilities in the DNS or otherwise impair the stability of 
          the authoritative root. But ICANN does have a role to play in educating 
          and informing about threats to the Internet's reliability and stability. 
          </p>
        <p>ICANN is a consensus development 
          body for the global Internet community, and its focus is the development 
          of consensus policies relating to the single authoritative root and 
          the DNS. These policies include those that allow the orderly introduction 
          of new TLDs. </p>
        <p>There are those&#150;including 
          operators of commercialized alternate roots&#150;who pursue unilateral 
          actions outside the ICANN consensus-development process. Many hope to 
          circumvent these processes by claiming to establish some prior right 
          to a top-level domain name. ICANN, however, recognizes no such prior 
          claim. ICANN will continue to reflect the public policy consensus of 
          the global Internet community over the private claims of the few who 
          try to bypass this consensus. </p>
        <p><i><b>In Short&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></i></p>
        <p><i>Just as there is a single 
          root for telephone numbers internationally, there must be a single authoritative 
          root for the Internet, administered in the public interest.</i></p>
