  <p class="title">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' (ICANN) - Nominating Committee, Open Leadership Positions 2013</p>
  <p class="docdate">Posted 7 November 2012</p>
</div>
<p>Candidates for all ICANN positions should be women and men with a high level of qualifications and experience with an international outlook including some familiarity with the Internet. They should be prepared to contribute to the collective and collaborative bottom-up policy making processes anchored by ICANN's Supporting Organizations, and Advisory Committees and the broader Internet community.</p>
<p>ICANN's Nominating Committee (NomCom) selects candidates to fill various leadership positions that will make a valuable public service contribution towards the continued function and evolution of an essential global resource, the Internet. Those candidates will work with accomplished colleagues from around the globe, address the Internet's intriguing technical coordination problems and policy development challenges with diverse functional, cultural, and geographic dimensions, and gain valuable insights and experience from working across boundaries of knowledge, responsibility and perspective.</p>
<h4>About ICANN</h4>
<p>To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer - a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without that coordination there would not be one global Internet. ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit corporation with participants from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. ICANN promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet's unique identifiers.</p>
<p>ICANN's mission is: to coordinate, at the overall level, the global Internet's systems of unique identifiers, and in particular to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique identifier systems. In particular, ICANN:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Coordinates the allocation and assignment of the three sets of unique identifiers for the Internet, which are:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Domain names (forming a system referred to as "DNS");</li>
    <li>Internet protocol ("IP") addresses and autonomous system ("AS") numbers; and</li>
    <li>Protocol port and parameter numbers.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Coordinates the operation and evolution of the DNS root name server system</li>
  <li>Coordinates policy development reasonably and appropriately related to these technical functions. (<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of the Internet; to promoting competition; to achieving broad representation of global Internet communities; and to developing policy appropriate to its mission through bottom-up consensus-based processes.</p>
<h4>Criteria and Time Commitments</h4>
<p>The NomCom will use the Criteria for Selection of ICANN Directors contained in Article VI, section 3 of the ICANN Bylaws for the selection of all candidates the NomCom is tasked with selecting. These Criteria are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Accomplished persons of integrity, objectivity, and intelligence, with reputations for sound judgment and open minds, and a demonstrated capacity for thoughtful group decision-making;</li>
  <li>Persons with an understanding of ICANN's mission and the potential impact of ICANN decisions on the global Internet community, and committed to the success of ICANN;</li>
  <li>Persons who will produce the broadest cultural and geographic diversity on the Board consistent with meeting the other criteria set forth in this Section;</li>
  <li>Persons who, in the aggregate, have personal familiarity with the operation of gTLD registries and registrars; with ccTLD registries; with IP address registries; with Internet technical standards and protocols; with policy-development procedures, legal traditions, and the public interest; and with the broad range of business, individual, academic, and non-commercial users of the Internet;</li>
  <li>Persons who are willing to serve as volunteers, without compensation other than the reimbursement of certain expenses; and</li>
  <li>Persons who are able to work and communicate in written and spoken English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, NomCom solicits advice from the Board (<a href="http://nomcom.icann.org/board-skills-advice-2012.htm">http://nomcom.icann.org/board-skills-advice-2012.htm</a>), the Supporting Organizations and he Advisory Committees on desirable skill sets for incoming Board members, in light of the challenges ahead and the current compositon of the Board.  Such advice is used by the NomCom to inform the Committeeâ€™s search and selection activities.</p>
<p>Given ICANN's Mission and Core Values, selectees engage in discussions on the technical functions coordinated by ICANN and their impact on the global Internet operation, such as its stability and integrity, or the effect on the users of the Internet. Selectees interact in a diverse environment, involving ICANN Board, ICANN Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees, as well as the broader Internet community, by means of a continuous, transparent and informed dialogue, as it corresponds to the ICANN multi-stakeholder concept.</p>
<p>Selectees will be part of groups that function in a collegial and cooperative manner, but in which individuals must also be prepared for intense debate in which tolerance and reasoning are necessary to accommodate and synthesize conflicting views. Careful consideration of the issues, depth of study of the precedents and environment, and the ability to deal clearly with conflict, including potentially conflicts of interest, are predictors of successful contributions to ICANN.</p>
<p>The NomCom welcomes and encourages Statements of Interests from all members of the global Internet community. Although candidates should be able to both work and communicate well in English, there is no requirement that English be the candidate's first language.</p>
<p>The time commitments identified below are a basic requirement and the NomCom anticipates that in most cases people will spend more time rather than less. All selectees should expect to spend an additional significant amount of time when joining ICANN on training and learning about the organization, its mission, history and mode of operation.</p>
<p>ICANN holds three Public Meetings per year. These meetings typically last for one week and are where the ICANN community gathers to discuss and develop policy and conduct ICANN's business. Public Meeting locations take place across ICANN's five geographic regions, for example the first meeting of 2013 will be held in the Asia/Australia/Pacific Islands region (Beijing, China), the second meeting will be held in the Africa region (Durban, South Africa) and the third meeting in the Latin America/Caribbean Islands region. All NomCom selectees are expected to travel and participate in ICANN's Public Meetings. Reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings will be reimbursed in accordance with ICANN's travel policies.</p>
<h4>Specific Position and Roles, Eligibility Factors, and Time Commitments</h4>
<h4>Nominating Committee Position Descriptions</h4>
<h4>ICANN Board of Directors</h4>
<p>To fill three vacancies on the ICANN Board, the NomCom is seeking accomplished persons of integrity, objectivity and intelligence who have (as referenced in Article VI, section 3 of the ICANN Bylaws):</p>
<ul>
  <li>a commitment to ICANN's mission and an understanding of the potential impact of ICANN decisions on the global Internet community</li>
  <li>demonstrated capacity for thoughtful group decision-making and sound judgment</li>
  <li>an understanding of the importance of good governance practices and an ability to contribute to the Board in this regard</li>
  <li>a willingness to serve either as a volunteer, or for an annual fee in accordance with the resolution passed by the Board on 8 December 2011 (currently the equivalent of US $35,000 annually, plus an additional the equivalent of US $5,000 if selected as Chair of a Board committee) (see<a href="http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-08dec11-en.htm#3">http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-08dec11-en.htm#3</a>), plus the reimbursement of reasonable expenses.</li>
  <li>an ability to work and communicate in written and spoken English (although there is no requirement that English be the candidate's first language)</li>
</ul>
<p>In filling these positions, the NomCom will be seeking to provide ICANN with members of the Board who reflect the global diversity of the Internet community and the wide range of technical, commercial and public interest activities that are impacted by the Domain Name System.</p>
<p>Time Commitment and Working Practice</p>
<p>The successful candidates will be appointed to the ICANN Board following the end of the 2013 Annual General Meeting, which is currently scheduled for 17 &ndash; 21 November 2013, through the end of the 2016 ICANN Annual General Meeting, which currently is expected to be held on 30 October 2016 &ndash; 3 November 2016.</p>
<p>The basic responsibilities of an ICANN Director require a commitment of time which when averaged out over the year, could reach up to 20 hours each week. The time spent in these basic responsibilities is typically clustered around Board meetings and teleconferences, but there is a constant flow of information requiring attention on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>Directors are generally expected to attend three ICANN Public Meetings each year, two Board retreats per year and work on Board Committees. Depending on the location and including travel time and preparation, a Public Meeting could be a commitment of up to ten (10) days per meeting and retreats could range from three to five days per meeting.</p>
<p>Directors also spend time preparing for and participating in telephonic Board meetings throughout the year, and spend additional time in connection with their work on <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/board_committees.html">Board Committees</a>, a commitment that varies in relation to the number of Board Committees on which they serve, the scope of the Committee's responsibilities, and their role as Chair or Member of the Committee.</p>

<p>Time Commitment and Working Practice</p>
<p>The successful candidates will be appointed to the GNSO Council following the 2013 ICANN Annual General Meeting, which is currently scheduled for 17 &ndash; 21 November 2013, through the end of the ICANN Annual General Meeting in 2015, which is currently scheduled for 18 &ndash; 22 October 2015.</p>
<p>The basic responsibilities of a GNSO Council member involve a minimum of 20 hours per month on Council related activities, with those chairing or participating in Working Groups or Task Forces spending up to 60 hours a month or more. Depending on work load, for example during the weeks before ICANN's three face-to-face Public meetings per year, this can sometimes escalate to as much as 20 hours per week or more. The commitment during ICANN's three Public meetings generally runsabout three days with council members sometimes having extensive responsibilities on most days. For those involved in Task Forces or Working Groups, there may occasionally be additional face-to-face interim meetings, and likely telephonic meeting throughout the year.</p>
<h4>ICANN Country Code Name Supporting Organization Council</h4>
<p>The Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) is a policy-development body responsible for developing and recommending to the Board global policies relating to country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs), nurturing consensus across the ccNSO's community, including the name-related activities of ccTLDs; and coordinating with other ICANN Supporting Organizations, Committees, and Constituencies.

<p>Time Commitment and Working Practice</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be appointed to the ccNSO Council immediately following the ICANN 2013Annual General Meeting, which is currently scheduled for 17 &ndash; 21 November 2013 through the end of the ICANN General Meeting in 2016, which is currently scheduled for 30 October 2016 &ndash; 3 November 2016.</p>
<p>An average ccNSO Council member would spend at least 12 hours per month on Council related activities, with those chairing Working Groups or Task Forces spending at least 30 hours a month. (The commitment involves a minimum of six hours per month based on an average of 1.5 two-hour teleconferences (or physical meetings) per month plus about two hours of preparation for each meeting for reading task force reports and potentially discussing with the community. Participation in committees of the council and/or task forces could easily double that minimum time commitment.)</p>
<h4>ICANN At Large Advisory Committee</h4>
<p>The At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) is the ICANN body responsible for representing the voice of the end user in policy and operational discussions. For more information on the work of the ALAC, see <a href="http://www.atlarge.icann.org/">http://www.atlarge.icann.org/</a>.</p>
