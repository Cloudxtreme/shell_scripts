  <h2>Letter of thanks</h2>



  <p>I would like to formally present my gratitude for the fellowship to the biggest event in terms of IP across Asia Pacific this year 2013. I have met and networked with great people in this part of the world, and made connections to resourceful people for many years to come.</p>



  <p>As you may be aware, our office (Office of the Government Chief Information Officer Vanuatu), is very new and this opportunity to attend APRICOT 2013, has given us a better understanding of what other governments around the Asia Pacific region are doing to take IP forward to reach their people and most of all support the operators and industry. It is also a great event to learn about available and future technologies that shape the way ICT &amp; Telecoms will operate. I would like to thank NSRC, ISOC, APIA, APNIC and APRICOT for my fellowship which has opened doors to many partnerships. I also thank all the sponsors and SGNIC for hosting APRICOT 2013, and all the hard working people behind the scenes whom I have not mentioned for your dedication to making this event a success. APRICOT will be an event that our office will be taking part in, in the future. I strongly encourage people from Vanuatu and other Pacific Island countries to attend future APRICOTs for their development. Until then, I will see you in APRICOT 2014 in Bangkok!</p>



  <p>Kind regards,</p>



  <p>Jackson Miake | ICT Program Manager | Office of the Government Chief Information Officer â€“ OGCIO<br />

  Prime Minister&#39;s Office | Government of the Republic of Vanuatu</p>

  <hr />



  <p>I am just writing to show my gratitude of having selected as one of the fellow for the recently concluded APRICOT 2013. I wanted to go to you personally after the closing conference but I noticed that you&#39;re busy entertaining the new hosts for APRICOT 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a great time learning during the workshop, conference and tutorial sessions. I hope I can be back someday to return the favor as a speaker / workshop instructor.</p>



  <p>Please give my regards to the fellowship committee at APIA / ISOC aswell.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you would continue with this program to further develop the competencies of other network engineers throughout the region.</p>



  <p>Best Regards,</p>



  <p>Nathanael C. Cariaga</p>

  <hr />



  <p>Its been an honor to meet with you at APRICOT 2013. Really its a wonderful program.</p>



  <p>I was one of the luckiest one who got the chance to get trained by Dr. Philip Smith. Also the some of the Conference and Peering Social was really great for me, my job and my career.</p>



  <p>Thanks for your support.</p>



  <p>Please do remember me, if I can help you or APRICOT/APNIC/APIA in the upcoming events in ASIA.</p>



  <p>With regards,</p>



  <p>SIMON</p>

  <h2>Expectations for Fellows</h2>



  <p>There are certain expectations we have for award recipients. These include that you:<br /></p>



  <ul>

    <li>Attend the APRICOT Newcomers Orientation Session. The APRICOT Newcomers Training will help orient you on the history, working methods, and culture of APRICOT. Your attendance at this training is important, as it will help you through the event&#39;s sessions. Of course, you are also expected to attend the APRICOT&#39;s meeting sessions that you have signed up for. Share your experience and the knowledge you gain at APRICOT with your local technical community.</li>



    <li>An important part of the program is for Fellows to share the knowledge they gained at APRICOT with others in their home country or region. This can be done, for example, by making a presentation at a relevant professional, academic, or technical meeting, speaking at an association meeting or local NOG/ISOC chapter event, writing an article for a relevant local publication, and so on. We ask that you provide verification of your APRICOT information sharing activities within six months of attending the meeting. If you publish an article, please send a URL or a scanned copy. If you speak at an event, please get it videotaped and post the video to youtube.com or other online video sharing service, and send the URL.</li>



    <li>Complete a Fellowship evaluation report after the meeting. We will ask you to complete a short report on your experience at APRICOT as an APRICOT Fellow. We will provide you with a form to fill out and ask that you return it to us within two weeks of attending the meeting.</li>



    <li>Help APRICOT with the administrative components of your Fellowship. We will email you with the steps that need to be taken in order to get you to the meeting. These include filling out APRICOT registration information, helping to find appropriate flights to get you to the meeting, and other details. We ask that you respond promptly and let us know as soon as possible should any problems arise. Please provide a valid email address, telephone number, and other contact information. Please fill in applications with sufficient detail.</li>

  </ul><br />



  <h2>Criteria for Selection</h2>



  <p>The APRICOT 2013 Fellowship Committee will select the fellows according to the following criteria:<br /></p>



  <ul>

    <li>Membership of the target audience listed above</li>



    <li style="list-style: none">Residency in a developing country</li>



    <li>Demonstrated ability to utilize the experiences gained from APRICOT</li>



    <li>Willingness to return to APRICOT as a presenter or trainer in the future</li>

  </ul>



  <p>Note: Candidates who have been prior recipients of a fellowship within the last four years from APRICOT or a related conference such as APNIC will not ordinarily be considered for fellowship.</p>



  <p>Applicants from any part of the world will be considered, however it is expected that the majority of fellows selected will be from the Asia Pacific region.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
