<p>Welcome to the Virtual Private Network Consortium, better known as VPNC.
VPNC is the international trade association for manufacturers in the VPN
market.

<p>Founded in 1999, the primary purposes of the VPNC are:

<ul>

<li>Promote the products of its members to the press and to potential
customers

<li> Increase interoperability between members to help them better serve
their potential customers

<li>Serve as the forum for the VPN manufacturers throughout the world

<li>Help the press and potential customers understand VPN technologies and
standards

</ul>

It should be noted that VPNC does not create standards; instead, it
strongly supports the current and future IETF standards.

<h2>VPNC interoperability testing</h2>

<p><a href="/testing.html"><img src="/testbasicinterop.gif" align="bottom"
     alt="VPNC interoperabilty logo" border=0></a>

<p>VPNC issues logos for interoperability to VPNC member products
which have successfully completed the testing.
This testing is available to our IPsec and SSL members. Read more about <a
href="/testing.html">VPNC's interoperability logos</a> and the products that
have received them.
