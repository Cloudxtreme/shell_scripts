There's an enormous amount of information available on the Web about
airlines and aviation.
This
web site
concentrates on two things: schedules, fares, reservations, and tickets for
commercial airlines, and on-line travel agents.
We list both airline-sponsored and independent information.
</p><p>
The first parts of this
web site
discuss on-line sources of airline schedules and fares,
of which there are several general-purpose services.
</p><p>
After that it lists airlines that have any of online schedules, fares,
reservations, ticket sales, and flight status.
</p><p>
Next comes a listing of on-line specials, sources of special fares and
other deals available over the net.
Many airlines have short-notice specials which are worth checking out.
</p><p>
The rest of the
web site
lists travel agents that offer service over the net
and have indicated that they'd like to be listed.  I am not a travel
agent (I consult and write computer books which you can find out about
<A HREF="http://www.johnlevine.com" target="link">here</A>,
and the agent listings are provided free to any agent that asks
and sends in a short description of what he or she offers.
</p><p>
<H2>Where is this web site's information available?</H2>
</p><p>
It's on the web at
<A HREF="http://airinfo.travel">http://airinfo.travel</A> or
http://airinfo.aero.
There are, unfortunately, a certain number of out of date copies of this
site floating around the net; the only one that's up to date is the
one at http://airinfo.travel or http://airinfo.aero.
<P>
This FAQ is also posted in text form on the usenet groups
<A HREF="news:rec.travel.air">rec.travel.air</A>,
rec.answers, and news.answers every Sunday.
</p><p>
<H2>How do on-line reservations work?</H2>
</p><p>
<a name="#howwork"><br /></a>
Four giant airline computer systems in the United States handle nearly
all the airline reservations in the country. (They're known as
CRSs, for computer reservations systems, or more often now
GDS for global distribution systems.) Although each airline has a
``home'' CRS, the systems are all interlinked so that you can,
with few exceptions, buy tickets for any airline from any CRS. The dominant
systems in the U.S. are
Sabre (home to American and US Airways), Galileo (home to United),
Worldspan (home to Delta, Northwest), and Amadeus
(many European lines.)
The company that owned Galileo and Orbitz
recently bought Worldspan, so the two GDS will presumably be merged.
Many of the low-price start-up airlines don't
participate in any of these systems but have their own Web sites where
you can check flights and buy tickets. Southwest, the largest and
oldest of the low-price airlines, doesn't participate, either.
Southwest's web site gets car and hotel info from Galileo, but the
info seems not to flow the other way.
<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=136622.10000008&type=3&subid=0" >Orbitz</a>
one of the big three online travel agencies, runs its own system which is
"direct connect" linked directly to many of the airlines.
</p><p>
In theory, all the systems show the same data; in practice, however,
they get a little out of sync with each other. If you're looking for
seats on a sold-out flight, an airline's home system is most likely to
have that last, elusive seat. If you're looking for the lowest fare to
somewhere, check all four systems because a fare that's marked as sold
out on one system often mysteriously reappears on another system.
Some airlines have rules about flight segments that are not supposed
to be sold together even though they're all available, and at least once
I got a cheap US Airways ticket on Expedia, which didn't know about
all the US Airways rules even though I couldn't get it on their own site or
Travelocity which did know about them.
On the other hand,
many airlines have available some special deals that are only on their
own Web sites and maybe a few of the online agencies. Confused? You should
be. We are.
</p><p>
The confusion is even worse if you want to fly
internationally. Official fares to most countries are set via a treaty
organization called the IATA, so most computer systems list only IATA
fares for international flights. It's easy to find entirely legal
``consolidator'' tickets sold for considerably less than the official
price, however, so an online or offline agent is extremely useful for
getting the best price. The airlines also can have some impressive online
offers on their web sites.
</p><p>
Here's our distilled wisdom about buying tickets online:
</p><p>
<UL><LI><p>
Check the online systems to see what flights are available
and for an idea of the price ranges. Check more than one CRS.
For tickets within the U.S. and Canada, the prices in the CRS are for
the most part the real prices that people are paying.
See 
<a href="services.phtml">the big online agencies</a>
for some good places to start.
</p></li><LI><p>
After you have found a likely airline, check that airline's
site to see whether it has any special Web-only deals. If a low-fare
airline has the route, be sure to check that one too, since most low-fare
airlines don't appear in CRS listings.
</p></li><LI><p>
If your schedule is flexible, check ticket bidding sites including
<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=24474.10001216&type=3&subid=3" >Hotwire</a> and
<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1866211-10370045" target="link">Priceline</a>
and ticket auctions such as
<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=79676.10000002&type=3&subid=3" >SkyAuction</a>
</p></li><LI><p>
You can also talk to travel agents, particularly if it's a route where you
aren't eligible for the lowest CRS fares, but remember that
agents get no commission on fares visible on the CRS, so you can expect
an agent to charge you for ticking them. 
</p></li><LI><p>
For international tickets, do all the steps above in this list, and
then check both online and with your agent for consolidator
tickets.
This is particularly important
if you don't qualify for the lowest published fare.
See Edward Hasbrouck's
<A HREF="http://hasbrouck.org/faq" target="link">Consolidators and Bucket Shops FAQ</A> for much
more detailed information on consolidator tickets.

<H2>June 2012 update</H2>
</p><p>
The U.S. airline industry is chronically in
dreadful shape, with Aloha, ATA, Skybus, Eos, Silverjet,
Maxjet, and now Zoom
having shut down.
Midwest merged into Frontier.
American finally gave up and declared bankruptcy in late November, but
is still flying and will likely emerge as all the other US
legacies have, or maybe merge with US Airways
Sun Country and Mesa are bankrupt but still flying,
Frontier went bankrupt but seems to be surviving as part of regional
carrier Republic,
and most of
the remaining airlines are hanging on with
a combination of somewhat higher fares (much higer for trans-Atlantic)
and very full planes, although the weak economy has kept them from raising
fares as much as they want.
Southwest and Airtran, two relatively healthy low-fare carriers
are merging, with the surviving airline Southwest with more east coast and
international routes.
</p><p>
Mexicana went bankrupt, stopped flying, and seems unlikely to resume. 
Malev and Flyglobespan failed,
Lufthansa has bought and probably will absorb bmi, which will give them
a substantial Heathrow hub, and
French all-business carrier l'Avion was absorbed
into British Airways' Openskies subsidiary,
which is looking kind of iffy itself.
Nonetheless, many US airlines reported a recent profitable quarter, so
other than the ongoing mergers of United and Continental, and Southwest
and Airtran, no big changes are imminent.
</p><p>
Airlines cut back schedules as the recession hits their customers, so
there are fewer seats on more crowded planes.
In some cases small several regional jet flights have been replaced by one
larger jet, but the overall trend is down.
</p><p>
Airlines are scrambling for revenue anywhere they can find it.
Fuel surcharges are now common across the industry, and can be several
hundred dollars on overseas flights.
Most US lines other than Southwest charge for all checked bags on domestic flights.
Many now charge for picking your own seat, and charge more if you pick
a decent seat by an exit row or bulkhead.
(The kindest way to think of it is that the prices have increased, but
you get a discount if you're willing to fly with no checked bag, sit in a
lousy seat, and bring your own lunch.)
Nobody includes meals on domestic
flights any more, although I have to say that the $7 salads and sandwiches
are often a lot better than the former free gray-green glop.
</p><p>
The airlines that aren't bankrupt have shrunk themselves and tried to raise
fares but and are sporadically profitable, largely depending
on fuel prices.
Beyond the ones that have shut down,
Mesa Air finally went bankrupt, but is still flying, both its commuter operations
and its go! subsidiary in Hawaii, now more or less merged with Mokulele.
Its survival depends on how successful it is at breaking leases on commuter jets
that no longer make sense to use.
Sun Country's options to emerge from bankruptcy are not promising.
</p><p>
A major effect of all of the bankruptcies and downsizing is that
airlines are much more thinly staffed than they used to be.
That means that problems tend to have worse effects and last longer
than they used to be.
</p><p>
United, chronically left at the altar, has merged
with Continental, after flirting with US Airways.  The surviving airline
will be United, unfortunately, even though painted to look
like Continental.
</p><p>
US Airways slogged through its second bankruptcy,
and merged with America West, with the combined company to be
called US Airways but run by the management of profitable America West,
which hasn't been bankrupt for a couple of years.
Their operations still aren't entirely integrated.
The staffs of the two airlines never liked each other, causing continuing
labor problems.
Nonetheless, they're taking a run at bankrupt American.
</p><p>
Low-cost Canadian airline JetsGo turned out to be so low
cost that it ran out of cash and died, Canjet retreated back to charters,
and surviving low cost competitor
Westjet and Air Canada aren't competing very hard, so Canadian airfare prices are not low
other than on Air Transat's vacation routes.
</p><p>
Passengers are subject to much more extensive screening than in the past,
including screening of checked baggage at check-in time, and, according
to news reports pat downs that approach groping.
Airlines recommend arriving at least an hour earlier than before.
In my experience the extra delay is rarely more than 15 minutes,
even with the extra baggage screening, although I usually fly out of
smaller airports, not big hubs where you can get the killer two hour lines.
The TSA has handed back screening at a surprising number of airports to
private contractors, all of whom wear outfits intended to look like TSA uniforms.
There is remarkable
inconsistency in procedures from one airport to another, particularly
with respect to your shoes, is worse than ever.
Don't put your shoes in a bin, do put your shoes in a bin, and they all
insist very loudly that whatever their rule is has always been the rule everywhere.
A variety of extra cost "trusted traveller" plans may allow people to get
through the screening faster, or may just involve waiting in a different
line.  The TSA makes no promises.
If you don't want to go through the X-ray machines, whose safety is nowhere
near as clear as the TSA would like you to believe, you can get a light body
massage instead.
They have
<A HREF="http://waittime.tsa.dhs.gov" target="link">a web site with estimated wait times</A>
based on averages in previous months, not real time numbers.
</p><p>
Other changes include: some airports have stopped curb-side baggage check,
anything vaguely resembling a knife or lighter may or may not be confiscated
(although lighters suddenly stopped being dangerous a year ago),
you're sometimes only allowed one carry-on plus a purse, briefcase, diaper bag or
the like,
non-passengers aren't allowed past security,
all passengers must have a document that looks like
a boarding pass at most airports to get past security,
you may have to put your toothpaste and shampoo 
in a baggie that may have to be a one quart size,
some parking areas close to terminals are closed.
But check-in clerks no longer ask you whether you packed your own suitcase.
