<H2><a name="r4">Current Status</a></H2>
  <P>

  The IPv4 address space is a 32 bit field. There are 4,294,967,296
  unique values, considered in this context as a sequence of 256
  &quot;/8s&quot;, where each &quot;/8&quot; corresponds to 16,777,216
  unique address values.

  </p><p>

  As noted in <a href="http://rfc5735.potaroo.net">RFC 5735</a> a
  number of address blocks are 'reserved.' There are a total of the
  equivalent of 35.078 /8 address blocks that are 'reserved'. (This is
  composed of 16 /8 blocks reserved for use in multicast scenarios, 16
  /8 blocks reserved for some unspecified future use, a /8 (0.0.0.0/8)
  for local identification, a /8 for loopback (127.0.0.0/8), and a /8
  reserved for private use (10.0.0.0/8).  Smaller address blocks are
  also reserved for other special uses.)

  </p><p>

  The remaining 220.922 /8 address blocks are available for use in the
  public IPv4 Internet.  The current status of the total IPv4 address
  space is indicated in Figure 1.

  <p>&nbsp;

  </p>
  <p>

   This allocated number pool is managed by the Regional Internet
   Registries, (RIRs) and the breakdown of IANA allocated address
   blocks to each of the RIRs is shown in Figure 2.

</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </p>

  <p>Any individual IPv4 address can be in any one of five states:  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>reserved for special use, or <li>part of the IANA unallocated
  address pool, </li><li>part of the unassigned pool held by an RIR,
  </li><li>assigned to an end user entity but not advertised in the routing
  system, or </li><li>assigned and advertised in BGP.</ul>
  <p>The current
    totals of IP addresses according to this set of states is shown in
    Figure 3.

  This status can be further categorized per RIR, as shown in Figure 4.

  </p><p>&nbsp;

  </p>
  <p>Another view of the address state pools is by grouping the address
    space into a sequence of /8s, and looking at state sub totals within
    each /8 address block.  The following view shows the current status
    of the IPv4 address space as 256 /8 columns each describing a pool
    of 16,777,216 addresses.

<h3>Allocations</h3>
  <P>

  IPv4 Address are drawn from the Unallocated Address Number Pool,
  administered by the IANA.  These allocations are made to the
  Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the allocation unit is in
  units of /8s.

  <h3>RIR Pools</h3>
  <p>

  Each RIR allocates from its locally administered number pool. When
  the pool reaches a low threshold size a further address block is
  allocated by IANA to the RIR. The allocation quantity is based on
  the allocation activity recorded by the RIR for the 18 months prior
  to the allocation request, rounded to the next largest /8 address
  block.  The pool size within each RIR over time can be derived from the
  allocation and assignment series data, producing the following
  graph. This is indicated in Figure 10.

  <h3>Models for Data Series</h3>
  <p>

  The foloowing figure constructs a relatively complete view of the
  sequences of various address pools over time. Figure 16 shows the total amount
  of space allocated by the IANA to the RIRs, the total amount of
  space that has been allocated by the RIRs, the total amount of space
  advertised in the routing table, the total amount of unadvertised
  space that has been allocated, and the total amount of address space
  that is held in the RIR's local allocation pools.  This is indicated
  in Figure 16. The objective here is to generate a predictive model
  that can be used to extend these series forward in time in order to
  estimate a point of exhaustion of the unallocated address pool

  The more recent section of these series is indicated in Figure 17.
  The approach used here is to take a recent sequence of data as the
  baseline for a predictive model.

  <h4>IANA Data Series</h4>

  <p>

  Before looking in detail at the advertised address space, the IANA
  allocation data and RIR allocation data will be examined, and a
  relatively straightforward form of data analysis will be performed
  over the data series.

  The IANA allocation data is indicated in Figure 18.

  <h3>Modelling RIR Allocations</h3>

  <p>

  The approach used here to modelling overall address consumption levels is
  to use the RIR allocation information as the baseline of the address
  consumption model. This approach treats an address as "consumed"
  once it has been allocated or assigned by an RIR. The data used to
  construct the time series of allocations is the allocation "stats
  file" published on a daily basis by each RIR, placed into a time
  series, as indicated in Figure 9. The first order differential of
  the smoothed total allocation rate can be generated, as shown in
  Figure 27.  A least squares linear best fit can be generated for the
  recent part of this data.

<!--
  By looking at historical data is also possible to model for each
  RIR a "low threshold" point for the RIR's unallocated address
  pool. When the RIR's unallocated address pool falls to this level it
  will request a further allocation of address blocks from IANA. The
  amount requested in this model is the lesser of 3 /8 address blocks
  and the cumulative sum of the RIR's address allocations over the
  previous 18 months. The model also assumes that the remainder of the
  address pool currently marked by the IANA as "Various" will not be
  used for further allocations until the IANA unallocated pool is
  exhausted.  This overall model is indicated in Figure 30.  This is
  also shown for AFRINIC (Figure 30a), APNIC (Figure 30b) ARIN (Figure
  30c), LACNIC (Figure 30d), the RIPE NCC (Figure 30e), and the
  "Various" address pool (Figure 30f).

  These individual RIR pool behaviours can be summed, as shown in
  Figure 31. Each upward movement in the RIR Pool series represents
  an IANA allocation to one of the RIRs, while the downward movement
  represents the cumulative address allocation rate across the RIR
  system.

  <h3>The Address Consumption Model</h3>

  <p>

  It is now possible to put the components together into a complete
  model.

  </p><p>

  The first is the projection of the advertised address span, which
  uses a second order polynomial (quadratic) growth model. This is shown in Figure 32.


  </p><p class="outdent">
  <a href="./fig30a.png" ><IMG src="./fig30a.png" width="90%"></a><BR>
  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Figure 32 - Projected Advertised Address Span (/8s)</i></font>
  </p>
  <p>

  To this can be added the projected unadvertised address span, which
  is modelled as a slower second order polynomial growth series. This is shown in
  Figure 33.

  </p><p class="outdent">
  <a href="./fig30b.png" ><IMG src="./fig30b.png" width="90%"></a><BR>
  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Figure 33 - Projected Advertised and Unadvertised Address Span (/8s)</i></font>
  </p>
  <p>

  The total address demand is the sum of these two address pools. This is
  shown in Figure 34

  </p><p class="outdent">
  <a href="./fig30c.png" ><IMG src="./fig30c.png" width="90%"></a><BR>
  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Figure 34 - Projected Address Consumption (/8s)</i></font>
  </p>
  <p>

  The RIR behavior to meet this demand rate can be added to this model, together
  with the demands on the IANA unallocated address pool, as shown in Figure 35.

  </p><p class="outdent">
  <a href="./fig30d.png" ><IMG src="./fig30d.png" width="90%"></a><BR>
  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Figure 35 - Projected RIR and IANA Consumption (/8s)</i></font>
  </p>
  <p>

  These components can be combined to create an overall model of address
  consumption, as shown in Figure 36.

  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Figure 38 - Projected remaining time until IANA and RIR Exhaustion over time</i></font>
  </p>

  <p>Figure 37 plots the predicted date of IANA exhaustion and the
  predicted date of the first RIR to exhaust, plotted against the date
  that the prediction was generated. Figure 37 shows the remaining
  time left until the predicted exhaustion dates at the time of the
  prediction.</p>

  <p>Figure 38 clearly shows the impact of the global financial crisis
  on the growth of the internet, from June 2008 until November 2009,
  when the effective IANA exhaustion data remained a constant 2 years
  into the future.Since November 2009 address consumption has resumed
  its levels of early 2008, and the data of exhaustion has remained
  relatively steady.</p>

  <p>The pronounced discontinuities are due predominately to policy
  changes i.e. IANA allocating an RIR no more than 2 /8s in a single
  transaction, withholding the last 5 /8s and treating them
  differently, changes to the planned treatment of the legacy space,
  and due to the inherent instability in these numbers. They are
  unstable because at present one half of all address allocations are
  distributed to 1/100 of all recipients (<a
  href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2009-05/fig11.png">http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2009-05/fig11.png</a>),
  implying any change in behaviour of a small subset of the population
  (namely the larger service providers)) produces a visible change in
  the predicted date of exhaustion.</p>




  <h3>Further Consumption</h3>
  <p>

  At this point it appears unlikely that all forms of IPv4 address distribution will cease at the time when the unallocated address pool is exhausted. One possible
  outcome is that some form of address distribution mechanism may bring the unadvertised address space back into play to fuel further demands for address space in the
  public IPv4 Internet. Without concern as to precisely what mechanisms may produce such an outcome, the question here is "how many years of additional growth in the
  advertised public Internet could be sustained if the unadvertised address pool were available for use by the public Internet?" In attempting to pose an answer to
  this question, the model used here assumes that a pricing function may apply to such addresses, and there would be a strong incentive to use various forms of address
  compression technologies to maximize the utility of such address blocks. The model used here assumes that the efficiency of the deployed address block would be a
  little over twice as efficient in such a regime.

  This particular model predicts that the use of the unadvertised
  address pool to sustain further growth on the IPv4 public Internet
  may provide addresses to meet demands until <b>[TDATE]</b>.

<h2><a name="r8">How Accurate is this Date?</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>

  This work indicates that if current consumption trends continue then
  some other form of address distribution mechanism will be needed
  before the IANA unallocated address pool exhaustion date of [IDATE],
  let alone prior to the RIR exhaustion date of [EDATE]. However this
  is perhaps a very conservative projection of a date for the
  exhaustion of the current address allocation policies. Its probable
  that an industry response to this forthcoming situation is one of
  increasing levels of demand for the remaining unallocated address
  resources, given the impetus of a &quot;last chance rush&quot; on
  the registries. If such a run on the unallocated address pool
  eventuates, and industry players bring forward their requests for
  additional address space, it is possible that this unallocated
  address pool exhaustion date may occur sooner than the model studied
  would apparently indicate. Such a run is difficult to model from
  existing data, and this exercise here has not attempted to undertake
  such forms of modelling of a run on the address pool. About the best
  we can conclude from this study is that in terms of an agenda for
  development of address distribution policies, this work supports the
  proposition that such policy development should have started by the
  end of 2005. There is a clear need for detailed consideration of
  what are the most appropriate ways to support the continued
  operation and growth of the Internet when the IPv4 unallocated
  address pool is exhausted. The response that the global Internet
  industry will undertake an overnight transition to use IPv6 is
  perhaps at one somewhat improbable end of a rather broad spectrum of
  possibilities here, if only from the consideration of the implausibility
  of such timing in a network of tis size.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><b>21 June 2011</b></p>

<p>I have revised this model somewhat, in an effort to introduce a
measure of uncertainty in the projection of exhaustion for each RIR.</p>

<p><b>25 November 2010</b></p>

<p>Like all projections, this "potaroo projection" is simply one
possible model of the future, based on certain assumptions about the
behaviour of the address allocation system, and based on the data
available only from published sources. This latter constraint does
impact the ability of the model to map cleanly to the current address
allocation framework.  Notably, the allocation system uses the concept
of "address reservations" in determining whether an RIR has reach a
threshold point that makes it eligible to apply to IANA for allocation
of further /8 address blocks. As these reservations are not part of an
RIR's published data, this adds some element of uncertainty to the
predictive model. The prospect of the forthcoming hiatus in the supply
of IPv4 addresses also appears to have hastened some network
deployment plans on the part of many service providers, and while the
RIRs continue to adhere to the policies and practices of allocation of
addresses in response to demonstrated need, there is a noted
escalation of demand for addresses in recent times that is likely to
persist in the coming months.</p>

<p>The November 2010 allocation of a /8 to AFRINIC was not predicted
by this model, due to the hidden factor of the reserved blocks in the
AFRINIC registry. The continued escalation of demand levels is also
adding some pressure to the demand model.</p>

<p>A <a href="ipv4.potaroo.net">conservative view</a> of predicted
address consumption forecasts APNIC exhausting its available address
pool in late 2011 at this point in time. A <a
href="http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2010-10/when.html">less
conservative model</a> that uses settings that reflect continued
escalation of demand through 2011 now forecasts APNIC exhausting its
address pools in September 2011. The uncertainty of this September
date is +/- 3 months, so that within a 95% confidence level APNIC will
exhaust its address pools sometime between June 2011 and December
2011.
</p>


<p><b>6 June 2010</b></p>

<p>I've made a couple of very slight changes to the RIR operational
model to align it to current practices. ARIN appears to to be
operating off a low threshold of slightly under 2 /8s in its
unallocated pool when if requests IANA for a further 2 /8s, and the
RIPE NCC use a low threshold value of slightly greater than 2 /8s in
its unallocated pool. This change to the model has had a small impact
on the predicted exhaustion dates.</p>
</p>

<p><b>11 May 2009</b></p>

<p>I've made a couple of changes to the prediction model to align with
current RIR practices and my understanding of the manner in which the
legacy B and C blocks will be managed by the RIRs.</p>

<p>The RIPE NCC has commenced allocations from 188.0.0.0/8 in February
2009. This is a legacy Class B block that is marked as "various". I've
moved this block into the RIPE-managed address pool and used the
recent allocations from this block as part of RIPE's total set of
allocation in terms of demand modelling RIPE's future needs.</p>

<p>The set of legacy /8s that used to be the old Class B and C space
is a set of approximately 50 /8s. A summary of these address blocks
can be found 
<a href="http://www.potaroo.net/bgp/ipv4-stats/allocated-various.html">here</a>.

After making the change for 188/8 there are the equivalent of 7.4731
/8s (or some 125.4 million addresses) unassigned in the remaining
"various" legacy /8 address blocks. At the time IANA reaches the last
5 /8s (the "IANA Exhaustion time" as defined by current address
allocation policies), these unassigned addresses in the legacy /8s are
then distributed evenly to the RIRs. However, as 188/8 was already
part of this collection of legacy /8 blocks, the distribution includes
a smaller allocation to the RIPE NCC. Using this algorithm, when IANA
reaches the last 5 /8s each RIR recceives a further 1.69462 /8s from
the "various" pool, except for RIPE, which recieves a further 0.69462
/8s.</p>
