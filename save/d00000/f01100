<A NAME="about"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">About Nmap</h2>

<P>Nmap (&ldquo;Network Mapper&rdquo;) is a free and open source
(<a href="http://nmap.org/data/COPYING">license</a>) utility for
network discovery and security auditing.  Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, monitoring host or
service uptime, and many other tasks.  Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.  It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts.  Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X.  In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
(<a href="http://nmap.org/zenmap/">Zenmap</a>), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
(<a href="http://nmap.org/ncat/">Ncat</a>), a utility for
comparing scan results (<a href="http://nmap.org/ndiff/">Ndiff</a>), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (<a href="http://nmap.org/nping/">Nping</a>).

<P>Nmap was named &ldquo;Security Product of the Year&rdquo; by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest.  It
was even featured in <a href="http://nmap.org/movies.html">a dozen
movies</a>, including
<a href="http://nmap.org/movies.html#matrix">The Matrix Reloaded</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/movies.html#bourne">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>.
<a href="http://nmap.org/movies.html#gwtdt">Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>, and
<a href="http://nmap.org/movies.html#diehard4">Die Hard 4</a>. Nmap was released to the public in 1997 and has earned the trust of millions of users.

<P>As free software, we don't have any sort of advertising budget.  So please spread the word that Nmap 6 is now available!

<br>
<A NAME="6changes"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Top 6 Improvements in Nmap 6</h2>

<P>Before we go into the <a href="#changes">detailed changes</a>, here
are the top 6 improvements in Nmap 6:

<dl>
<dt><b>1. NSE Enhanced</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse.html">Nmap Scripting
Engine (NSE)</a> has exploded in popularity and capabilities. This
modular system allows users to automate a wide variety of networking
tasks, from querying network applications for configuration
information to vulnerability detection and advanced host discovery.
The script count has grown from 59 in Nmap 5 to 348 in Nmap 6, and all
of them are documented and categorized in
our <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/">NSE Documentation
Portal</a>. The underlying NSE infrastructure has improved
dramatically as well. [<a href="#changes-nse">More details</a>]
</dd>

<dt><b>2. Better Web Scanning</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>As the Internet has grown more web-centric, Nmap has developed
web scanning capabilities to keep pace.  When Nmap was first released
in 1997, most of the network services offered by a server listened on
individual TCP or UDP ports and could be found with a simple port
scan.  Now, applications are just as commonly accessed via URL path
instead, all sharing a web server listening on a single port.  Nmap
now includes many techniques for enumerating those applications, as
well as performing a wide variety of other HTTP tasks, from web site
spidering to brute force authentication cracking.  Technologies such
as SSL encryption, HTTP pipelining, and caching mechanisms are well
supported. [<a href="#changes-web">More details</a>]
</dd>

<dt><b>3. Full IPv6 Support</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses</a>, the Internet community is trying to move to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6">IPv6</a>.  Nmap has been a leader in the transition, offering basic IPv6 support since 2002.  But basic support isn't enough, so we spent many months ensuring that Nmap version 6 contains full support for IP version 6.  And we released it just in time for the <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">World IPv6 Launch</a>.

<p>We've created a new IPv6 OS detection system, advanced host
discovery, raw-packet IPv6 port scanning, and many NSE scripts for
IPv6-related protocols.  It's easy to use too&mdash;just specify the
-6 argument along with IPv6 target IP addresses or DNS records.  In
addition, all of our web sites are now accessible via IPv6. For
example, Nmap.org can be found
at <literal>2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:fe96:967c</literal>.  [<a href="#changes-ipv6">More details</a>]

</dd>

<dt><b>4. New Nping Tool</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>The newest member of the Nmap suite of networking and security tools is <a href="http://nmap.org/nping/">Nping</a>, an open source tool for network packet generation, response analysis and response time measurement.  Nping can generate network packets for a wide range of protocols, allowing full control over protocol headers. While Nping can be used as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet generator for network stack stress testing, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, etc. Nping's novel <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nping-man-echo-mode.html">echo mode</a> lets users see how packets change in transit between the source and destination hosts. That's a great way to understand firewall rules, detect packet corruption, and more. [<a href="#changes-nping">More details</a>]
</dd>

<dt><b>5. Better Zenmap GUI &amp; results viewer</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>While Nmap started out as a command-line tool and many (possibly most) users still use it that way, we've also developed an enhanced GUI and results viewer named Zenmap.  One addition since Nmap 5 is a &ldquo;filter hosts&rdquo; feature which allows you to see only the hosts which match your criteria (e.g. Linux boxes, hosts running Apache, etc.)  We've also localized the GUI to support five languages besides English.  A new <a href="http://nmap.org/book/zenmap-profile-editor.html#zenmap-profile-editor-scripting">script selection interface</a> helps you find and execute Nmap NSE scripts.  It even tells you what arguments each script supports. [<a href="#changes-zenmap">More details</a>]
</dd>

<dt><b>6. Faster scans</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>In Nmap's 15-year history, performance has always been a top
priority.  Whether scanning one target or a million, users want scans
to run as fast as possible without sacrificing accuracy.  Since Nmap 5
we've rewritten the traceroute system for higher performance and
increased the allowed parallelism of the Nmap Scripting Engine and
version detection subsystems.  We also performed an intense memory
audit which reduced peak consumption during our benchmark scan by 90%.
We made many improvements to Zenmap data structures and algorithms as
well so that it can now handle large enterprise scans with ease. [<a href="#changes-performance">More details</a>]

<h2 class="purpleheader">Screen Shots</h2>

<P>Nmap 6 provides a wealth of information about remote systems, as shown in this sample scan against a machine we maintain for scan testing purposes (<a href="http://scanme.nmap.org">scanme.nmap.org</a>):

<p><img width=888 height=706 src="screenshots/nmap6-scanme-terminal-888x706.gif">

<p><img width=916 height=1065 src="screenshots/zenmap6-example-916x1065.gif">

<p>Perhaps the most visually appealing aspect of Zenmap is its <a href="http://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html">network topology mapper</a>.  Here it is being used to interactively explore the routes between a source machine and more than a dozen popular web sites:

<h2 class="purpleheader">Detailed Improvements</h2>

<P>The <A HREF="http://nmap.org/changelog.html">Nmap Changelog</A>
describes more than 600 significant improvements since our last major
release
(<A HREF="http://nmap.org/5">5.00</A> in July 2009).
Here are the highlights:

<A NAME="changes-nse"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)</B></font>

<P>The <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse.html">Nmap Scripting Engine
(NSE)</a> is one of Nmap's most powerful and flexible features. It
allows users to write (and share) simple scripts to automate a wide
variety of networking tasks. Those scripts are then executed in
parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap. Users can
rely on the growing and diverse set of scripts distributed with Nmap,
or write their own to meet custom needs.  NSE was just beginning to
take off with Nmap 5, and represents perhaps our proudest
accomplishment in Nmap 6:

<UL>

<LI><P>Script count has nearly sextupled from 59 to 348 scripts!  The
full list is too long to include here, but you can find them all at
the <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/">NSE Documentation
Portal</a>.</LI>

<LI><P>Information gathering is one of Nmap's prime features, so we added 44 new protocol information query scripts:

<LI><P style="margin-bottom:0">Some of our favorite new scripts don't send any traffic at all&mdash;they just interpret and present information discovered by other scripts or Nmap itself.  These include:
<UL>
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/address-info.html">address-info</a> shows extra information about IPv6 addresses, such as embedded MAC or IPv4 addresses when available.  
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/creds-summary.html">creds-summary</a> lists all discovered credentials (e.g. from brute force and default password checking scripts) at end of scan.
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/duplicates.html">duplicates</a> attempts to discover multihomed or IP aliased systems by analyzing and comparing information collected by other scripts (SSL certificates, SSH host keys, MAC addresses, and NetBIOS server names).
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/reverse-index.html">reverse-index</a> creates a reverse index at the end of scan output showing which hosts run a particular service. 
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/unusual-port.html">unusual-port</a> compares the detected service on a port against the expected service for that port number (e.g. ssh on 22, http on 80) and reports deviations.  
</UL>

<LI><P>Nmap has <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-script-types">two new NSE script scanning phases</a>. The new pre-scan
occurs before Nmap starts scanning. Some of the initial pre-scan
scripts use techniques like broadcast DNS service discovery or DNS
zone transfers to enumerate hosts which can optionally be treated as
targets. The other phase (post scan) runs after all of Nmap's scanning
is complete.  These can do things like print summaries of all the host-specific results or find correlations.  For example, <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssh-hostkey.html">ssh-hostkey</a> can now tell you at the end of the scan which IP addresses have duplicate SSH host keys (and thus may be different interfaces of the same machine) and  <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/reverse-index.html">reverse-index</a> prints an index at the end of a scan showing which hosts have individual services (such as telnet or http) available.

<LI><P>Created a
new <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/target.html">target
library</a> which allows scripts to add newly discovered targets to
Nmap's scanning queue. This allows Nmap to support a wide range of
target acquisition techniques. 27 scripts can now use this feature:

<LI><P>We created a high speed authentication credential checking library for our protocol brute force password auditing scripts.  We then added 48 new &ldquo;brute&rdquo; scripts, for a total of 53 (<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/brute.html">full list</a>).  Supported protocols range from extremely popular ones such as 
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-brute.html">HTTP</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-brute.html">FTP</a>,

and <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/pop3-brute.html">pop3</a>
to more obscure ones such as

<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rpcap-brute.html">RPcap</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/redis-brute.html">Redis</a>, and
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/iscsi-brute.html">iSCSI</a>.
We even support brute force cracking of other security scanning and
exploitation tools, including 
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/metasploit-xmlrpc-brute.html">Metasploit XML-RPC</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nessus-brute.html">Nessus</a>,

and <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/openvas-otp-brute.html">OpenVAS OTP</a>.

<LI><P>Since brute force scripts are most effective with a quality password list, we created a <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nselib/data/passwords.lst">top 5000 password database</a> by cracking 635,546 passwords from the <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/674">Gawker compromise</a> and combining those results with many other leaks such as RockYou, PHPBB, MySpace, etc.

<LI><P>We added a <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/creds.html">credentials storage library</a>.  This makes it easy for credentials passed in by the user or discovered by brute force scripts to then be used for deeper interrogation, and also allows for consistent reporting of discovered credentials.

<LI><P>We <a href="http://bit.ly/nmapafp.">discovered a major directory traversal vulnerability</a> in Apple AFP protocol and <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/afp-path-vuln.html">released a script</a> for detecting and exploiting the problem</a>

<LI><P>Added and then removed a mac-geolocation script which relied on
a Google database to determine strikingly accurate GPS coordinates for
anyone's wireless access point based on their MAC address.  It was
very powerful and arguably a little creepy.  Google must have decided
that the capability was too powerful as they discontinued the service
before our script was even two months old.

<LI><P>Added a new <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-script-selection">script force feature</a>.  You can force scripts to
  run against target ports (even if the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; service is detected)
  by placing a plus (+) in front of the script name passed to --script.

<LI><P>Added a new --script-args-file option which allows you to specify
  the name of a file containing all of your desired NSE script
  arguments. The arguments may be separated with commas or newlines
  and may be overridden by arguments specified on the command-line
  with --script-args.

<LI><P>Added a <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html#nse-api-registry">host-based registry</a> which only persists (for the given
  host) until all scripts have finished scanning that host. The normal
  registry saves information until it is deleted or the Nmap scan
  ends. That is a waste of memory for information which doesn't need
  to persist that long. Use the host based registry instead if you
  can.

<LI><P>Replaced our runlevel system for managing the order of script
  execution with a <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse-script-format.html#nse-format-dependencies">much more powerful dependency system</a>. This allows
  scripts to specify which other scripts they depend on (e.g. a brute
  force authentication script might depend on username enumeration
  scripts) and NSE manages the order. Dependencies only enforce
  ordering, they cannot pull in scripts which the user didn't
  specify.

<LI><P>A new --script-help option describes all scripts matching a
given specification. It accepts the same specification format as
--script does. For example, try &lsquo;nmap --script-help "default or
http-*"&rsquo;.

<LI><P>The script arguments which start with a script name
(e.g. http-brute.hostname or afp-ls.maxfiles) can now accept the
unqualified arguments as well (hostname, maxfiles). This lets you use
the generic version (&ldquo;hostname&rdquo;) when you want to affect multiple
scripts, while using the qualified version to target individual
scripts. If both are specified, the qualified version takes precedence
for that particular script. This works for library script arguments
too (e.g. you can specify 'timelimit' rather than unpwdb.timelimit).


<LI><P>Created a new <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/broadcast.html">broadcast script category</a> for scripts which broadcast on the local network and discover information and/or potential target hosts from the responses.  We already have 31 of them:

<P><font size="+1"><B>Web Scanning Improvements</B></font>

<p>As the Internet has grown more web-centric, Nmap has developed
web scanning capabilities to keep pace.  When Nmap was first released
in 1997, most of the network services offered by a server listened on
individual TCP or UDP ports and could be found with a simple port
scan.  Now, applications are just as commonly accessed via URL path
instead, all sharing a web server listening on a single port.  Nmap
now includes many techniques for enumerating those applications, as
well as performing a wide variety of other HTTP tasks, from web site
spidering to brute force authentication cracking.  Technologies such
as SSL encryption, HTTP pipelining, and caching mechanisms are well
supported.  Nmap 6 offers many major improvements:

<UL>

<LI><P style="margin-bottom:0">Increased the number of NSE scripts for scanning web servers from 6 to 54. Some of our favorite new scripts are:
<UL>
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-title.html">http-title</a> simply determines the title of the root page of any web servers detected when scanning. It's the sort of trivial script which was easy to write and yet provides valuable insights on target hosts.
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-backup-finder.html">http-backup-finder</a> spiders a website and attempts to identify backup copies of discovered files by by requesting a number of different combinations of the filename (e.g. index.bak, index.html~, copy of index.html).
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html">http-enum</a> enumerates directories used by popular web applications and servers by checking more than 2,000 URI paths.  This is perhaps our closest analogue to port scanning the web.
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-favicon.html">http-favicon</a> grabs a site's favicon file (the tiny icon which is often shown in the URL bar while browsing) and checks whether it is from a known content management system or other application.  We used it to scan hundreds of thousands of popular web servers as part of our <a href="http://nmap.org/favicon/">Icons of the Web</a> project.
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-grep.html">http-grep</a> spiders a web site attempting to find pages which match a given pattern.
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-cert.html">ssl-cert</a> retrieves and prints a target server's SSL certificate.
</UL>

<LI><P>Added a new <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/lib/httpspider.html">httpspider library</a> which is used for recursively
  crawling web sites for information.  New scripts using this
  functionality include 
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-backup-finder.html">http-backup-finder</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-email-harvest.html">http-email-harvest</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-grep.html">http-grep</a>,
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-open-redirect.html">http-open-redirect</a>, and
<a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-unsafe-output-escaping.html">http-unsafe-output-escaping</a>.

<LI><P>The HTTP library now caches responses from http.get or
http.head so that resources aren't requested multiple times during the
same Nmap run even if several scripts request them.

<LI><P>Added HTTP pipelining support to the HTTP library and and to
  the http-enum, http-userdir-enum, and sql-injection.nse
  scripts. Pipelining can increase speed dramatically for scripts
  which make many requests.

<LI><P>Server Name Indication (SNI) is now supported by Ncat and
  Nmap NSE, allowing them to connect to servers which run multiple SSL
  websites on one IP address. To enable this for NSE, the nmap.connect
  function has been changed to accept host and port tables (like those
  provided to the action function) in place of a string and a
  number.

</UL>


<A NAME="changes-ipv6"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>IPv6 Support</B></font>

<p>Given
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">exhaustion
of available IPv4 addresses</a>, the Internet community is trying to
move to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6">IPv6</a>.  Nmap
has been a leader in the transition, offering basic IPv6 support since
2002.  That included basic (connect) port scans, basic host discovery,
version detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine.  But that's not
enough, so we spent many months ensuring that Nmap version 6 contains
full support for IP version 6.  And we released it just in time
for the <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">World IPv6
Launch</a>.  It's easy to use too&mdash;just specify the -6 argument
along with IPv6 target IP addresses or DNS records.  Our
new IPv6 support includes:

<UL>

<LI><P>Raw packet IPv6 port scanning is now supported.  This allows for IPv6 raw packet host discovery (IPv6 echo requests, TCP/UDP discovery packets, etc.) and raw packet port scanning (SYN scan, UDP scan, ACK scan, and more).  IPv6 protocol scan (-sO) is also supported, and we wrote an IPv6 traceroute implementation (--traceroute) too.

<LI><P>Added
  an <a href="http://nmap.org/book/osdetect-ipv6-methods.html">IPv6 OS
  detection system</a>! The new system utilizes many tests similar to
  IPv4, and also some IPv6-specific ones that we found to be
  particularly effective. And it uses a machine learning approach
  rather than the static classifier we use for IPv4. We hope to move
  some of the IPv6 innovations back to our IPv4 system if they work
  out well. The database is still very small, so please submit any
  fingerprints that Nmap gives you to the specified URL (as long as
  you are certain that you know what the target system is
  running). Usage and results output are basically the same as with
  IPv4, and the implementation
  is <a href="http://nmap.org/book/osdetect-ipv6-methods.html">documented
  here</a>.  For an example, try running "nmap -6 -O scanme.nmap.org".

<LI><P style="margin-bottom:0">Since the IPv6 address spaces is too large to brute force scan in general (like we do with IPv4), we researched IPv6 host discovery techniques for finding all the machines on a local network.  We ended up implementing the four techniques we found most effective.  The are all implemented as NSE scripts which can simply print out discovered addresses or (if requested) add them to Nmap's target queue.  Since each technique may discover a different set of hosts, we recommend using multiple techniques or even specify all four.  Here they are:

<UL>
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-ipv6-multicast-echo.html">targets-ipv6-multicast-echo</a> sends an ICMPv6 echo request packet to the all-nodes link-local multicast address (ff02::1). When ICMP echo response packets are received, collect the IPv6 addresses that they come from and mark those hosts as potential scan targets.  This is a rather straightforward technique which uses the protocols as designed, and (just like using ICMPv4 echo request packets for host discover) it is quite effective.

<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-ipv6-multicast-invalid-dst.html">targets-ipv6-multicast-invalid-dst</a>
sends an ICMPv6 packet with an invalid extension header to the
all-nodes link-local multicast address. Any hosts replying with an
ICMPv6 parameter problem packet can be marked as up and available for
potential scanning.


<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-ipv6-multicast-mld.html">targets-ipv6-multicast-mld</a> attempts to discover available IPv6 hosts on the LAN by sending an MLD (multicast listener discovery) query to the link-local multicast address (ff02::1) and listening for any responses.  The query's maximum response delay set to 0 to provoke hosts to respond immediately rather than waiting for other responses from their multicast group.

<li><a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/targets-ipv6-multicast-slaac.html">targets-ipv6-multicast-slaac</a> sends an ICMPv6 router acknowledgment packet with a random address prefix, causing hosts to begin stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) and send a solicitation for their newly configured address. We can then guess the remote addresses by combining the link-local prefix of the interface with the interface identifier in each of the received solicitations. An ordinary ICMPv6 neighbor discovery probe can then be used to verify that the guessed addresses are correct.
</UL>

<P>An example command to find all the IPv6 hosts on your local network using all four of these techniques in combination is: &ldquo;nmap -v -n -sn --script targets-ipv6-\*&rdquo;

<LI><P>Added IPv6 Neighbor Discovery ping. This is the IPv6 analog to IPv4
  ARP scan. It is the default ping type for local IPv6 networks.

<LI><P><a href="http://scanme.nmap.org">Scanme.Nmap.Org</a> (the system anyone is allowed to scan for testing
  purposes) is now dual-stacked (has an IPv6 address as well as IPv4)
  so you can scan it during IPv6 testing.  We also added a DNS record
  for scanmeV6.nmap.org which is IPv6-only. So you can check if your current system can already handle IPv6 by trying to visit <a href="http://scanmev6.nmap.org">the ipv6-only scanme site</a>.  You might be surprised!  We have posted <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/428">more details here</a>.

<LI><P>The <a href="http://nmap.org">Nmap.org</a> website as well as sister sites <a href="http://insecure.org">Insecure.Org</a>,
  <a href="http://seclists.org">SecLists.Org</a>, and <a href="http://sectools.org">SecTools.Org</a> all have working IPv6 addresses now
  (dual stacked).  For example, Nmap.org can be found at
  2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:fe96:967c.

<LI><P>Ncat now supports IPV6 addresses by default without the -6 flag.
  Additionally Ncat listens on both ::1 and localhost when passed
  -l, or any other listening mode unless a specific listening address is
  supplied.

<P><a href="http://nmap.org/zenmap/">Zenmap</a> is our cross-platform
(Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, etc.) Nmap GUI and results viewer.  It aims
to provide advanced features for experienced Nmap users while also
making Nmap easier for beginners to use.  Frequently used scans can be
saved as profiles to make them easy to run repeatedly. A command
creator allows interactive creation of Nmap command lines. Scan
results can be saved and viewed later, or even
compared with one another to see how they differ. Our <a href="http://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html">network topology viewer</a> allows for interactive exploration of a network scanned with Nmap.  While Zenmap
already existed in Nmap 5.00, we've made many improvements since then:

<UL>

<LI><P>Added a new script selection interface, allowing you to
  choose scripts and arguments from a list which includes descriptions
  of every available script. Just click the "Scripting" tab in the
  profile editor.

<LI><P>Localized most of the remaining strings in the GUI interface
  which were English-only. The actual textual Nmap results are still
  in English since Nmap, but the GUI is now almost fully localized.
  Supported translations (so far) are Brazilian Portuguese, French,
  German, Hungarian, and Russian.  Instructions for switching to a different language or even for writing and contributing your own translation are <a href="http://nmap.org/book/zenmap-lang.html">available here</a>.

<LI><P>After performing or loading a scan, you can now filter
  results to just the hosts you are interested in by pressing Ctrl+L
  (or the "Filter Hosts" button) to open the host filtering interface.
  This makes it easy to select just Linux hosts, or those running a
  certain version of Apache, or whatever interests you. You can easily
  modify the filter or remove it to see the whole scan again. This feature is <a href="http://nmap.org/book/zenmap-filter.html">documented here</a>.

<LI><P>We made a ton of performance improvements, as documented in the <a href="#changes-performance">performance section</a> of these release notes.

</UL>

<A NAME="changes-performance"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Performance Improvements</B></font>

<p>In Nmap's 15-year history, performance has always been a top
priority.  Whether scanning one target or a million, users want scans
to run as fast as possible without sacrificing accuracy.  Improvements since Nmap 5 include:

<UL>
<LI><P>Nmap's --traceroute has been rewritten for better performance.
  Probes are sent in parallel to individual hosts, not just across all
  hosts as before. Trace consolidation is more sophisticated, allowing
  common traces to be identified sooner and fewer probes to be sent.
  The older traceroute could be very slow (taking minutes per target)
  if the target did not respond to the trace probes, and this new
  traceroute avoids that. In a trace of 110 hosts in a /24 over the
  Internet, the number of probes sent dropped 50% from 1565 to 743,
  and the time taken dropped 92% from 95 seconds to 7.6
  seconds. Traceroute now uses an ICMP echo request probe if no
  working probes against the target were discovered during
  scanning.

<LI><P>Improved the Zenmap output viewer to show new output in constant
  time. Previously it would get slower and slower as the output grew
  longer, eventually making Zenmap appear to freeze with 100% CPU.

<LI><P>Greatly improved Zenmap's performance for large scans by
  benchmarking intensively and then re-coding dozens of slow parts.
  Time taken to load our benchmark file (a scan of just over a million
  IPs belonging to Microsoft corporation, with 74,293 hosts up) was
  reduced from hours to less than two minutes. Memory consumption
  decreased dramatically as well.

<LI><P>Improved OS detection performance by scaling congestion control
  increments by the response rate during OS scan, just as was done
  for port scan before.

<LI><P style="margin-bottom:0">Performed a memory consumption audit and made changes to
  dramatically reduce Nmap's footprint.  This improves performance on
  all systems, but is particularly important when running Nmap on
  small embedded devices such as phones.  Our intensive UDP scan
  benchmark saw peak memory usage decrease from 34MB to 6MB, while OS
  detection consumption was reduced from 67MB to 3MB.  Full details were <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/663">posted here</a>, and the highlights are:
  <UL>  
  <LI>The size of the internal representation of nmap-os-db was reduced
    more than 90%. Peak memory consumption in our OS detection
    benchmark was reduced from 67MB to 3MB.

  <LI>The size of individual Port structures without service scan
    results was reduced about 70%.

  <LI>When a port receives no response, Nmap now avoids allocating a
    Port structure at all, so scans against filtered hosts can be
    light on memory.

<A NAME="changes-nping"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Nping packet generation and response analysis tool</B></font>

<P><a href="http://nmap.org/nping/"><img src="http://nmap.org/nping/images/logos/nping_logo_257x423.png" width=257 height=423 alt="Nping Logo" align="right"></a>

<p>Nping is an open source tool for network packet generation, response
analysis and response time measurement. Nping can generate network
packets for a wide range of protocols, allowing users full control over protocol headers.  While Nping can be used as a simple ping
utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet generator
for network stack stress testing, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks,
route tracing, etc.  Nping's novel <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nping-man-echo-mode.html">echo mode</a> let's users see how packets change in transit between the source and destination hosts. That's a great way to understand firewall rules, detect packet corruption, and more.
</p>

<p>
Nping has a very flexible and powerful command-line interface that grants
users full control over generated packets.  Features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom TCP, UDP, ICMP and ARP packet generation.</li>
<li>Support for multiple target host specification.</li>
<li>Support for multiple target port specification.</li>
<li>Unprivileged modes for non-root users.</li>
<li><a href="http://nmap.org/book/nping-man-echo-mode.html">Echo mode</a> for advanced troubleshooting and discovery.</li>
<li>Support for Ethernet frame generation.</li>
<li>Support for IPv6 (currently experimental).</li>
<li>Runs on Linux, Mac OS and MS Windows.</li>
<li>Route tracing capabilities.</li>
<li>Highly customizable.</li>
<li>Free and open-source.</li>

<A NAME="changes-infrastructure"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Infrastructure Improvements</B></font>

<P>Keeping the Nmap project vibrant and productive (for developers and users) requires constant investment in our development.  Our software and hardware from Nmap's early days in 1997 (or even Nmap 5 in 2009) just don't cut it any more.  Improvements since Nmap 5 include:

<UL>

<LI><P>We set up a new Subversion (SVN) source code revision control server for the Nmap codebase.  This one uses SSL
  for better security, WebDAV rather than svnserve for greater
  functionality, is hosted on a faster (virtual) machine, provides
  Nmap code history back to 1998 rather than 2005, and removes the
  need for the special "guest" username.  The new server is at
  <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap</a> and instructions on using it are <a href="http://nmap.org/book/install.html#inst-svn">available here</a>.

<LI><P>Created a special wiki for Nmap development and community-generated documentation at <a href="http://secwiki.org">SecWiki.Org</a>.

<LI><P>One of the most successful pages on our
  new <a href="http://secwiki.org">SecWiki.Org</a> so far is
  our <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_Script_Ideas">NSE script
  ideas page</a>.  If you have a good idea, post it to the incoming
  section of the page.  Or if you're in a script writing mood but
  don't know what to write, come here for inspiration:
  https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_Script_Ideas.

<LI><P>More than 3,000 Nmap users filled out a survey of their
favorite (non-Nmap) tools, and we tabulated the results to launch a
new version of our top tools site
at <a href="http://sectools.org">SecTools.Org</a>.  It now includes
user ratings and reviews, tracks release dates, offers searching and
sorting, and even lets you nominate your own favorite tools.  It's
like a frickin' Yelp for security tools!

</UL>

<A NAME="changes-ncat"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Ncat</B></font>

<P><a href="http://nmap.org/ncat/">Ncat</a> is a feature-packed
networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from
the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project as a
much-improved reimplementation of the
venerable <a href="http://sectools.org/tool/netcat/">Netcat</a>.  It
uses both TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a
reliable back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to
other applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and
IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of
potential uses.

<p>Among Ncat’s vast number of features there is the ability to chain
Ncats together, redirect both TCP and UDP ports to other sites, SSL
support, and proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP (CONNECT method)
proxies (with optional proxy authentication as well). Some general
principles apply to most applications and thus give you the capability
of instantly adding networking support to software that would normally
never support it.

<p>We made a number of great improvements to Ncat in Nmap 6:

<UL>

<LI><P>Ncat now has configure-time ASCII art just like Nmap does:
<pre>
            .       .
            \`-"'"-'/
             } 6 6 {
            ==. Y ,==
              /^^^\  .
             /     \  )  Ncat: A modern interpretation of classic Netcat
            (  )-(  )/
            -""---""---   /
           /   Ncat    \_/
          (     ____
           \_.=|____E
</pre>

<LI><P>Created a portable version of ncat.exe that you can just drop
  onto Microsoft Windows systems without having to run any installer
  or copy over extra library files. See the <a href="http://nmap.org/ncat/">Ncat page</a> for binary downloads and a link to build instructions.

<LI><P>Updated Ncat's SSL certificate store (ca-bundle.crt), primarily to
  remove the epic fail known as DigiNotar.

<LI><P>Implemented basic SCTP client functionality in client mode
  (server already exists).  Only the default SCTP stream is used.
  This is also called TCP compatible mode.  While it allows Ncat to be
  used for manually probing open SCTP ports, more complicated services
  making use of multiple streams or depending on specific message
  boundaries cannot be talked to successfully.

<LI><P>Implemented SSL over SCTP in both client (connect) and server
  (listen) modes.
</UL>


<A NAME="changes-portability"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Portability Enhancements</B></font>

<P>We made dozens of portability changes to improve Nmap compilation and execution on Mac OS X 0.7, Solaris 9, 10, and 11; AIX 6.1 & 7.1; OpenSolaris; IBM ZLinux; Arch Linux, and many other platforms.  Most of these are not listed here because you can read them by searching for your desired platform in the <a href="http://nmap.org/changelog.html">full CHANGELOG</a>.  But here are a few particularly interesting portability improvements:

<UL>
<LI><P>Our Mac OS X packages are now x86-only (rather than universal),
  reducing the download size from 30 MB to about 17.  If you still
  need a PowerPC version (Apple stopped selling those machines in
  2006), you can use Nmap 5.51 or 5.61TEST2 (<a href="http://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D">available here</a>).

<LI><P>Refactored the Nsock library to add the nsock-engines system. This
  allows system-specific scalable IO notification facilities to be
  used while maintaining the portable Nsock API. This initial version
  comes with an epoll-based engine for Linux and a select-based
  fallback engine for all other operating systems. Also added the
  --nsock-engine option to Nmap, Nping and Ncat to enforce use of a
  specific Nsock IO engine.

<LI><P>We no longer support Nmap on versions of Windows earlier than XP
  SP2.  Even Microsoft no longer supports Windows versions that old.  But if you must use Nmap on such systems anyway, we've <a href="https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_On_Old_Windows_Releases">provided some tips</a>.
</UL>

<A NAME="changes-osdetect"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Operating system detection</B></font>

<P>Thanks to fingerprint submissions from thousands of Nmap users around the world, our <a href="http://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html">remote operating system detection system</a> grew from 2,003 signatures in Nmap 5 to 3,572 now.  These include the latest versions of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X as well as more specialized entries such as oscilloscopes, ATM machines, employee timeclocks, DVRs, game consoles, and much more.  Some of the newest fingerprints are for Apple iOS 5.01, OpenBSD 5.0, FreeBSD 9.0-PRERELEASE, and a ton of new WAPs, routers, and other devices.

<P>In addition to more than 1,500 new fingerprints, we made several important performance improvements and bug fixes to the system.

<A NAME="changes-vscan"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Version detection</B></font>

<P>The days when we could assume what was running on an open port based on the port number are long gone.  These days, folks commonly run services on the "wrong" port numbers in order to defeat filtering policies, hide traffic, or work around various networking problems.  Fortunately, Nmap's <a href="http://nmap.org/book/vscan.html">version detection system</a> is able to  interrogate the service listening on the open port and tell you the service running as well as (in many cases) the application name and version number.  Nmap 5 had an impressive 5,512 signatures matching 511 protocols, but Nmap 6 improves that to 8,165 signatures for 862 protocols!


<A NAME="changes-more"></A>
<P><font size="+1"><B>Even more improvements</B></font>

<P>In addition to the pages of changes listed above, we made many improvements which defy simple categorization:

<UL>

<LI><P>Added Common Platform Enumeration (CPE, http://cpe.mitre.org/)
  output for OS and service versions. This is a standard way to
  identify operating systems and applications so that Nmap can
  better interoperate with other software. Nmap's own (generally more
  comprehensive) taxonomy/classification system is still supported as
  well. Some OS and version detection results don't have CPE entries
  yet. CPE entries show up in normal output with the headings "OS
  CPE" and "Service Info":
<pre>
    OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:kernel:2.6.39
    Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:kernel
</pre>
  These also appear in XML output, which additionally has CPE entries
  for service versions.

<LI><P>Nmap now supports the old-school Gopher protocol thanks to our handy <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/gopher-ls.html">gopher-ls</a> NSE script.  We even support Gopher over IPv6!

<LI><P>Enabled the ASLR and DEP security technologies for Nmap.exe,
  Ncat.exe and Nping.exe on Windows Vista and above. Visual C++ will
  set the /DYNAMICBASE and /NXCOMPAT flags in the PE
  header. Executables generated using py2exe or NSIS and third party
  binaries (OpenSSL, WinPcap) still don't support ASLR or DEP. Support
  for DEP on XP SP3, using SetProcessDEPPolicy(), could still be
  implemented. [<a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/328">more details</a>]

<LI><P>Nmap now determines the filesystem location it is being run from and
  that path is now included early in the search path for data files
  (such as nmap-services).  This reduces the likelihood of needing to
  specify --datadir or getting data files from a different version of
  Nmap installed on the system.  For full details, see <a href="http://nmap.org/book/data-files-replacing-data-files.html">the docs</a>.

<LI><P>Made the final IP address space assignment update as all available
  IPv4 address blocks have now been allocated to the regional
  registries.  Our random IP generation (-iR) logic now only excludes
  the various reserved blocks.  Thanks to Kris Katterjohn for years of regular
  updates to this function!

<LI><P>The -V and --version options now show the platform Nmap was compiled
  on, which features are compiled in, the version numbers of libraries
  it is linked against, and whether the libraries are the ones that
  come with Nmap or the operating system.

<LI><P>Dramatically improved nmap.xsl (used for converting Nmap XML output
  to pretty HTML).  You can find the newest copy of the file <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl">here</a> and <a href="http://nmap.org/tmp/newxsl.html">this</a> is an example of rendered output.

<LI><P>Ports are now considered open during a SYN scan if a SYN packet
  (without the ACK flag) is received in response. This can be due to
  an extremely rare TCP feature known as a <a href="http://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/npa/article/view/285">simultaneous open or split
  handshake connection</a>.  The nmap-dev discussion thread <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/723">starts here</a>.

<LI><P>When Nmap is passed a hostname such as google.com which
  resolves to several IP addresses, Nmap now prints each IP address.
  It still only scans the first one in the returned list unless you
  use the
  new <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/resolveall.html">resolveall</a>
  NSE script.

<LI><P style="margin-bottom:0">Switched to -Pn and -sn as the preferred syntax for skipping
  ping scan and skipping port scan, respectively. Previously the -PN
  and -sP options were recommended. This establishes a more regular
  syntax for options that disable phases of a scan:
  <UL>
  <LI>-n disables reverse DNS
  <LI>-Pn disables host discovery (assumes all target hosts are up)
  <LI>-sn disables port scanning
  </UL>
  <P>We also felt that the old -sP ("ping scan") option was a bit
  misleading because current versions of Nmap can go much further
  (including -sC and --traceroute) even with port scans disabled. We
  will retain support for the previous option names for the foreseeable
  future.

<LI><P>Nmap now provides Christmas greetings and a reminder of Xmas scan (-sX) when run in verbose mode on December 25.

<LI><P>For some UDP ports, Nmap will now send a protocol-specific payload
  that is more likely to get a response than an empty packet is. This
  improves the effectiveness of probes to those ports for host
  discovery, and also makes an open port more likely to be classified
  open rather than open|filtered. The ports and payloads are defined
  in a new <a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nmap-payloads">nmap-payloads</a>.  We now have payloads for 19 services including DNS (port 53), snmp (161), isakmp (500), NFS (2049), etc.

<LI><P>Nmap now prefers to display the hostname supplied by the user instead
  of the reverse-DNS name in most places. If a reverse DNS record
  exists, and it differs from the user-supplied name, it is printed
  like this:
<pre>
Nmap scan report for www.google.com (74.125.53.103)
rDNS record for 74.125.53.103: pw-in-f103.1e100.net
</pre>
  And in XML it looks like:
<pre>
  &lt;hostnames&gt;
    &lt;hostname name="openbsd.org" type="user"/&gt;
    &lt;hostname name="cvs.openbsd.org" type="PTR"/&gt;
  &lt;/hostnames&gt;
</pre>

<LI><P>The <a href="http://nmap.org/book/ndiff-man.html">Ndiff man
  page</a> was dramatically improved with examples and sample output.
  Ndiff is a handy tool for comparing two Nmap scans to find out about
  newly opened ports, service changes, etc.

<LI><P>Ndiff now shows changes in script (NSE) output for each target
  host (in both text output format and XML).

<LI><P>Nmap now generates IP addresses without duplicates (until you cycle
  through all the allowed IPs) in random target mode (-iR) thanks to a new collision-free 32-bit
  number generator in nbase_rnd.c.  Details in their full mathematical glory are <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/695">available here</a>.
</UL>

<P>These are all just highlights from the full list of changes you can
find in <a href="http://nmap.org/changelog.html">our CHANGELOG</a>.


<A NAME="future"></A>
<h2 class="purpleheader">Moving Forward (Future Plans)</h2>

<P>With this stable version out of the way, we are diving headfirst
into the next development cycle.  Many exciting features are in the
queue, including:
<UL>
<LI><P>An updater system for obtaining the latest NSE scripts, OS fingerprint updates, and other improvements in near real time.

<LI><P>To improve the user experience, we're adding various browser
toolbars, search engine redirectors and associated adware to the
Windows installer.  Not!  We'd never <a href="http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html">pull a sleazy CNET Download.com tactic</a>, but it emphasizes
why you should download Nmap from the true source&mdash;<a href="http://nmap.org">Nmap.Org</a>.

<LI><P>High speed port scanning through http or socks proxies (or chains of proxies)
<LI><P>Even more <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/">NSE scripts</a> to make the lives of network administrators and security practitioners easier.  348 scripts is impressive, but not enough.

have submitted OS and service/version fingerprints, as well as
everyone who has found and reported bugs or suggested features.

<P>Special thanks go to Google, who has sponsored 59 students (total over the last 8 years) to spend a summer working on Nmap as part of Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code program</a>.  This summer, we have an <a href="http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/204">impressive team of five students</a> who have already started work!
