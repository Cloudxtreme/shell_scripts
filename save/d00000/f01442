<div class="content text-content">
  <h1 id="changes-whitelistblacklist">Whitelist or Blacklist URLs in your tests!</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Wednesday, May 1, 2013</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Blacklisting</strong> useful for excluding 3rd-party scripts such as Facebook 
    like/share widgets, Google Analytics scripts, Youtube embeds and any other 
    external widgets you might want to be not be part of your page load.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, <strong>whitelisting</strong> a URL will ONLY serve resources from that domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both support a wildcard (*) that will designate all resources that begin 
    with the URL inputted as blacklisted/whitelisted.
  </p>
  <h2>How do I do it?</h2>
  <p>
    The Whitelist/Blacklist URLs feature is located in the "Advanced Options" 
    dropdown on the Dashboard in the "Advanced" tab, or the "Page Settings" modal on 
    the Report page also in the "Advanced" tab.
  </p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130501/url-blacklist-whitelist-dashboard.png" width="627" height="334" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Input your desired URLs and hit Go!</div>
  </div><br />
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130501/url-blacklist-whitelist-page-settings.png" width="627" height="360" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Input your desired URLs, Save your settings, and retest!</div>
  </div>

  <h4>To Whitelist a URL</h4>
  <p>
    This means that GTmetrix will ONLY grab resources from the URL you designated 
    for analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example 1 - Single URL:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Inputting <code>http://www.domain.com/foo/</code> will result in testing that ONLY includes 
    resources referencing that URL. References to other URLs, even on the same 
    domain (ie. <code>http://www.domain.com/bam/</code>), are NOT included in the analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example 2 - Wildcard:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Inputting <code>http://www.domain.com*</code> will result in testing that ONLY includes 
    resources referencing that entire domain. The wildcard(*) designates that all 
    resources that begin with the inputted URL will be whitelisted (eg. 
    <code>http://domain.com/image.jpg</code>, <code>http://domain.com/js/script.js</code>" will be part of the 
    report, where as <code>http://anotherdomain.com/image.jpg</code> will not be).
  </p>
  <h4>To Blacklist a URL</h4>
  <p>
    This means that GTmetrix will EXCLUDE resources from the URL you designated for 
    analysis.  
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example 1 - Single URL:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Inputting <code>http://www.domain.com/foo/</code> will result in testing that excludes 
    resources referencing that URL. All references to other URLs will still be 
    included (eg. <code>http://domain.com/bam/</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example 2 - Wildcard:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Inputting <code>http://www.domain.com*</code> will result in testing that 
    excludes all resources referencing that entire domain.  The wildcard(*) 
    designates that all resources that begin with the inputted URL will be 
    blacklisted (eg. <code>http://domain.com/image.jpg</code>, 
    <code>http://domain.com/js/script.js</code>" will not be part of 
    the report)
  </p>
  <h1 id="changes-mobile">Mobile Testing Now Available</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Thursday, April 11, 2013</div>
  <p>We're proud to offer page testing through Android-powered mobile devices.</p>

  <p>Currently, two Samsung Galaxy Nexus phones comprise our mobile testing suite, allowing users to generate GTmetrix reports based off actual page loads on these devices.</p>
  <p>In addition, GTmetrix uses Google's PageSpeed rules with their prioritization for mobile devices.  This ensures that characteristics of mobile devices and their connections are considered first in the recommendations.  Google changes these rules often however, and some are experimental at the moment.</p>
  <p>YSlow does not have a specific ruleset for mobile devices, so your score will remain similar to the desktop analysis.</p>
  <p>More devices are planned for the future as usage increases, as well as more device options (like iPhones or other Android devices) as we mature the service.</p>
  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <p>Our new mobile testing features can be accessed on both our Dashboard and Page Settings modal on the GTmetrix reports page.</p>

  <p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/mobile-advanced-options.png" width="627" height="540" alt="" />
  </div>
  <p>Click on the "Advanced Options" tab under the Analysis field.  Under the "Test Format" options, change the default "Firefox (Desktop)" option, with "Chrome (Android, Galaxy Nexus)", then click "Go!" A mobile report will be generated for you.</p>

  <p><strong>Mobile testing is still in Beta!</strong></p>
  <p>It was quite a technical challenge for us to implement actual mobile devices for analyses so please bear with us as we work out all the kinks.  We should also note a few things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's currently only available in our default, Vancouver, BC test region.</li>
    <li>We may have to take things down to make changes.</li>
    <li>We currently only have two phones available, so you may experience queues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Currently, we're using our beta phase to experiment, test, debug and give our users a glimpse of how their sites perform on mobile devices.  However, depending on popularity, mobile analyses may become a PRO only feature.</p>



  <h1 id="changes-connection">Simulate Different Connection Speeds for Loading Your Page</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Thursday, April 11, 2013</div>
  <p>Currently, GTmetrix loads your pages at the full speed of our datacentres' Internet connections.  This is fine with the generation of the PageSpeed and YSlow reports - as they currently do not have any rules that are affected by connection speed and latency - but the page timings and waterfall graphs are hugely affected by these factors.</p>
  <p>You can now change the connection speed GTmetrix uses to analyze your page to simulate up to 5 different connections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cable (5/1 Mbps, 30ms)</li>
    <li>DSL (1.5 Mbps/384 Kbps, 50ms)</li>
    <li>3G Mobile (1.6 Mbps/768 Kbps, 200ms)</li>
    <li>2G Mobile (240/200 Kbps, 400ms)</li>
    <li>56K Dial-Up (50/30 Kbps, 125ms)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will be able to see the effects of the connection speed in the page load times and waterfall graphs.  Enable the video capture option to see these slower speeds affect your users!</p>

  <p><strong>How to do this</strong></p>
  <p>Connection speeds can be modified on both our Dashboard and Page Settings modal on the GTmetrix reports page.</p>

  <p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/connection-throttle-advanced-options.png" width="627" height="540" alt="" />
  </div>
  <p>Click on the "Advanced Options" tab under the Analysis field.  Under the "Test Format" options, change the default "Unthrottled Connection" option, with your desired connection speed, then click "Go!" A report will be generated with your connection <em>throttled</em> to simulate a Dial-Up/2G/3G/DSL/Cable connection.</p>



  <h1 id="changes-filmstrip">Get an Alternate View of Your Page Load With Filmstrip</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Thursday, April 11, 2013</div>
  <p>Visualizing how your page loads is a difficult task.  HAR files are too technical for some, and video playback is difficult to dissect (often a page goes from a blank screen to a complete page in a split second).</p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/filmstrip.png" width="700" height="120" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Identify where elements load with filmstrip view.</div>
  </div>
  <p>Filmstrip gives you another way to visualize your page load by generating snapshots of your site load - from the first request to page completion. and can reveal blocks, bottlenecks and any other loading issues.</p>

  <strong>How to Generate a Filmstrip</strong>
  <p>View a GTmetrix report with a video created, then click on "Timeline".  Click "Generate Filmstrip", and GTmetrix will create a frame-by-frame view of your page load.</p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/generate-filmstrip.png" width="700" height="214" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Filmstrips need to be generated to be viewed.</div>
  </div>
  <p>Filmstrips can only be generated on Reports that have videos created on them - enable the "Create video" option in the Page Settings and "re-test" to create a video.</p>
  <p>If a re-test is performed on a report with an existing filmstrip, you'll need to regenerate the filmstrip.</p>



  <h1 id="changes-ui">UI Changes</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Thursday, April 11, 2013</div>
  <p>We've done a bit of clean up to our settings and options pages to make it easier and more logical to find the features you want.</p>
  <p>You'll notice our Advanced Options tab has been improved on the Dashboard.</p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/new-page-settings.png" width="657" height="612" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">New User Settings</div>
  </div>
  <p>The introduction of tabs in the top right corner let's us put popular or most used settings in the foreground, and move more advanced and technical features into the background.</p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/new-advanced-options.png" width="620" height="567" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">New Advanced Options</div>
  </div>
  <p>Setting up an Alert is now housed in the Page Settings modal, and is now an easier process with direct links to pre-requisite functions if you've not met the requirements for setting one up.</p>
  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20130408/new-alerts-warning.png" width="647" height="293" alt="" />

    <div class="caption">New Alerts Setup</div>
  </div>
  <p>We hope these new settings and option layouts improve your GTmetrix experience. Happy optimizing!</p>



  <h1 id="changes-gtmetrixpro">New Video Playback Feature</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Thursday, October 18, 2012</div>

  <p>
    GTmetrix now offers video playback of page loads! You can see how your page
    loads and pin point exactly where bottlenecks or stoppages occur.
  </p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20121018/thumbnail-play-button.png" width="700" height="259" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Reports that have video playback have a play button overlaid on top of the screenshot thumbnail.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Slow pages up to 4 times their original speed to determine issues, and jump
    to major page load milestones such as DNS Resolved, First Byte and DOM
    Loaded (only with Chrome, Safari or IE9+).
  </p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20121018/video-playback-full.png" width="700" height="411" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">View your page load in the eyes of your users.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Other uses for your page load videos:
  </p>

  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>View the difference latency has on your page loads (eg. loading from our different test locations) - this includes ads</li>
    <li>View the different ads or other regional based content</li>
    <li>View why the page was slow (when used with the monitored alerts option - note that this is a <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/pro/">GTmetrix PRO</a> only option)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When used with our monitored alerts feature, GTmetrix will save a video of
    the page load that triggered the alert for viewing (only available to
    <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/pro/">GTmetrix PRO</a> users).
  </p>

  <p>
    API users can also add video playback to their feature list. It costs 5 API
    credits to generate a video recording of a page load.
  </p>

  <p>
    Video playback is only available to registered GTmetrix users. Log in to
    your account and give it a try today!

  <h1 id="changes-hardiff">HAR Diff</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Tuesday, June 14th, 2011</div>

  <p>
    GTmetrix uses Jan Odvarko's
    <a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-viewer/">HAR Viewer</a> to
    give our users a way to visualize page loads via elegant waterfall graphs.
    Today, we're happy to announce HAR Diff, an add-on we wrote for HAR Viewer
    to allow the comparison of 2 waterfall graphs side-by-side!
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="/">Compare two sites and try it for yourself</a> or take a look at
    <a href="http://gtmetrix.com/compare/kkJrvNPv/jFNfForA/#report-timeline">our sample comparison</a>
    comparing <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> from our Vancouver,
    Canada and Sydney, Australia test regions.
  </p>

    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20110614/hardiff-colour.jpg" width="700" height="156" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Colours indicate the type of change occurred.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Color key:</p>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>
      White: The resource status, size, or timings haven't changed
      significantly (small timing changes are ignored).
    </li>
    <li>
      Orange: The resource status, size, or timings have changed.  Bolded
      orange text indiciates what has changed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Green: The resource was added in the second waterfall.
    </li>
    <li>
      Red: The resource was missing in the second waterfall.
    </li>
    <li>
      Blue: The resource is present in both waterfalls, but was loaded in a
      different order.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can enlarge the HAR Diff by clicking on "View Larger Version", or open
    it in a new window to view the waterfalls in a full window.

  <h1 id="changes-test-servers">New Test Server Regions</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Wednesday, June 1st, 2011</div>

  <p>
    We're pleased to announce new test server regions to analyze your URLs.  In
    addition to our main Vancouver test region, you can now test your URL in
    Dallas, London or Sydney.  Like the other test options, log in to access
    this new functionality.
  </p>

  <h1 id="changes-graphs">Performance History graphs improvements</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Thursday, March 17th, 2011</div>

  <p>
    In this round of updates, we've added 2 major features to GTmetrix and
    fixed some bugs.
  </p>

  <h2>Complete History Viewing</h2>
  <p>
    Previously, you could only view the last 30 days of your reports in the
    "History" tab.  We've now made it so you can view your <em>entire</em>
    report history.  Some new UI elements are added to facilitate that process:
  </p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20110317/date-selector.jpg" width="700" height="109" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Select the start and end date for your desired range.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is the date range selector.  Click on the calendar to select the start
    date and end date of your range, and the graphs will regenerate to display
    all the reports within that range.
  </p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20110317/zoom-range.jpg" width="700" height="114" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">You can zoom in 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is the zoom panel.  You can select how close you would like to see
    your range of reports.  From 1 day, to 1 year, to All.  When zoomed in, you
    are also able to pan left and right using the arrows.
  </p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20110317/click-drag-zoom.jpg" width="700" height="240" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Click and drag on the graph to zoom in on your desired range.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Another way to zoom is to click and drag a range on your graph.  You'll
    zoom in on your defined range; use the Pan arrows to move left and right.
  </p>

  <h2>Averaged graph points</h2>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20110317/averaged-point.jpg" width="700" height="240" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Reports close in proximity will be averaged into a single point.  You can zoom in via the tooltip.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    When there are several reports in close proximity within a range, they are
    averaged into a single point.  You can zoom into that range by clicking on
    the "Zoom in" option in the tooltip.
  </p>

  <h2>Annotations</h2>

  <p>
    You can now add notes and comments on your graph to help track changes.
  </p>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/20110317/note-screen.jpg" width="700" height="270" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">You can also edit notes by clicking on the speech bubbles.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In the History tab, click on the "Add Note" button, then move the cursor
    over the graph.  You'll notice the pointer replaced with a crosshair.
    Click where you want to add the note.  After a note has been added, it is
    indicated at the top of the graph with a speech bubble and a vertical blue
    line.

  <h1 id="changes-cookies-ipv6">Added Session Cookies and IPv6 support</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Tuesday, December 14, 2010</div>
  <p>
    Advanced users can now analyze logged-in pages (like Facebook profiles) by
    specifying cookies. This will simulate a logged in session and generate a
    GTmetrix report for that page.

  <h1 id="changes-history-waterfall">New "History" Tab and Waterfall Graph Functionality</h1>
  <div class="changes-timestamp">Monday, May 17, 2010</div>

  <p>
    In this latest update, we've made some changes to the <em>Breakdown</em>
    section of the reports page to allow for a more streamlined user
    experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes Overview</h2>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>The "Performance History" tab and "Report History" tab have been combined under a new tab called "History"</li>
    <li>A new tab has been added called "Timeline."  This contains tab contains the waterfall graph.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="screenshot">
    <img src="http://static.gtmetrix.com/r112/images/changes/tab-changes.jpg" width="534" height="314" alt="Previous vs Newest report Breakdown section" />
    <div class="caption">The previous and new report Breakdown section</div>
  </div>

  <h2>The new "History" tab</h2>
  <p>
    The "History" tab contains all of the graphs that were previously under the
    "Performance History" tab.  We've added tool tips to the nodes that allow
    you to:
  </p>

  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li>View the highlighted report (if you're not already viewing it)</li>
    <li>Compare the highlighted report to the currently viewed report</li>
    <li>Delete the highlighted report</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This provides our users with a more visual way of keeping track of past reports.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">Tool tips now appear on each node for every graph.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>The new "Timeline" tab</h2>
  <p>
    GTmetrix now generates a waterfall graph for each report.  You can easily
    see how your site elements load and troubleshoot any problem areas that you
    may see.  You can view a full version of the graph by clicking "View Larger
    Version" on the top right-hand corner of the graph.
