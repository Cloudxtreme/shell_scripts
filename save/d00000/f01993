    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <h3>Use of Content from this Website</h3>
    <p>The Smithsonian Institution (the “Smithsonian”) provides the content on this website (<a 
            href="http://si.edu">www.si.edu</a>), other Smithsonian websites, and third-party sites on which it maintains a presence (“SI Websites”) in support of its mission for the “increase and diffusion of knowledge.”  The Smithsonian invites visitors to use its online content for personal, educational and other non-commercial purposes. By using the SI Websites, you accept and agree to abide by the following terms.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
	
	<h3>Intellectual Property Rights in Content</h3>
    <p>The Smithsonian is the owner of the compilation of content that is posted on the SI Websites, which consists of text, images, audio, video, databases, design, codes and software (“Content”).   However, the Smithsonian does not necessarily own each component of the compilation.  The  Content that the Smithsonian makes available on the SI Websites  may be owned by  the Smithsonian,  owned by others and used with their permission (such as user-generated content), or used in accordance with applicable law.  Some Content is in the public domain and some Content is protected by third party rights, such as copyright, trademark, rights of publicity, privacy, and contractual restrictions.</p>
    <p>Smithsonian Content is identified as having “no known copyright restrictions” when the Smithsonian is unaware of any copyright restrictions on its use.  This may mean that: (1) a copyright existed at one time but was not renewed, or the copyright may have expired, or the owner may have intentionally placed the Content into the public domain; or (2) the Content was never eligible for copyright protection because it was created by an employee of the United States as part of his or her official duties, or (3) there are no copyright markings or other indications on the Content to indicate that it was copyrighted or otherwise restricted; or (4) Smithsonian records do not indicate any evidence of copyright restrictions. These facts do not necessarily mean that the Content is in the public domain, but rather indicate that no evidence has been found to show that copyright restrictions apply.</p>   
    <p>The Smithsonian endeavors to provide information that it possesses about the copyright status of the Content and to identify any other terms and conditions that may apply to use of the Content (such as trademark, rights of privacy or publicity, donor restrictions, etc.); however, the Smithsonian can offer no guarantee or assurance that all pertinent information is provided or that the information is correct in each circumstance.  It is your responsibility to determine what permission(s) you need in order to use the Content and, if necessary, to obtain such permission.  If you have specific questions or information about Content on the SI Websites, please contact the appropriate Smithsonian museum or program that is associated with the Content.</p>

	<h3>Permitted Uses</h3>
    <p>The Smithsonian welcomes you to make fair use of the Content as defined by copyright law.Information on United States copyright fair use law is available from the United States Copyright Office:   
        <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html</a>.  Please note that you are responsible for determining whether your use is fair and for responding to any claims that may arise from your use.</p>
       <p>
           In addition, the Smithsonian allows personal, educational, and other non-commercial uses of the Content on the following terms:<br />
       </p>
       <ul class="list">
           <li>You must cite the author and source of the Content as you would material from any printed work.<br />
               <br /></li>
           <li>You must also cite and link to, when possible, the SI Website as the source of the Content.<br />
               <br /></li>
           <li>You may not remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices including attribution information, credits, and notices, that are placed in or near the text, images, or data.<br />
               <br /></li>

	<h3><a title="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</a></h3> 	
	<p><strong>May I put Smithsonian Content on my personal website, blog or my Facebook® (or other social networking) page?</strong></p> 	
	<p>Yes, so long as you:</p>
    <ul class="list">
    <li>Identify the author and source of the Content;<br />
        <br />
       </li>
    <li>Do not remove any copyright, trademark, or other notices that are placed in or near the Content you use;<br />
        <br />
       </li>
    <li>Do not use the Content to promote, advertise, or sell your own products or services or for any other commercial or unauthorized purpose; and<br />
        <br />
       </li>
    <li>Comply with any other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to the Content.<br />
        <br />
        </li>
		</ul>
	<p><strong>Is it an unauthorized use if the host of my website or blog adds advertising to my website or blog?</strong></p> 	
	<p>If that is the only commercial aspect of your website or blog, you may post the Content on that site consistent with these Terms of Use.</p>
	
	<p><strong>I love the Smithsonian sunburst logo! May I use it on my website?</strong></p>	
	<p>No. You may not use the Smithsonian logo or other trademarks without the Smithsonian’s prior written permission.</p> 
	
	<p><strong>But what if I want use the Smithsonian logo as a link to the Smithsonian website?</strong></p> 	
	<p>Even so, you need the Smithsonian’s prior written permission to use its logo or other trademarks for any purpose (other than fair use as defined by trademark law). For linking, please use a text link, not the logo.</p>
	
	<p><strong>May I use Smithsonian Content on t-shirts that I plan to sell?</strong></p>	
	<p>No, this would be a commercial use. If you wish to make a commercial use, you must obtain prior written permission. Contact: 
        <a href="mailto:rightsmanager@si.edu">rightsmanager@si.edu</a>.</p> 	
		
	<p><strong>If I find Smithsonian Content on a website such as the Flickr Commons and the Content is described as having “no known copyright restriction,” how may I use the Content?</strong></p> 	
	<p>The phrase “no known copyright restriction” means that the Smithsonian has determined, to the best of its ability based on available information, that the Content is unlikely to be protected by copyright interests and, in all likelihood, is in the public domain.  However, copyright is often difficult to determine with certainty, so the phrase is intended to say that the Smithsonian is unaware of any copyright restriction, but such restrictions may still exist.  In addition, even if the Content is unrestricted from a copyright standpoint, there may be other considerations that would limit your use, such as rights of privacy or publicity of the individuals featured in the images, or contractual restrictions. For these reasons, the Smithsonian makes its content available for personal and non-commercial educational uses consistent with the principles of fair use.  If you decide to use the Content for commercial or other purposes without undertaking to clear all rights, you will be responsible if someone else owns the rights and the owner objects to your use.</p>
