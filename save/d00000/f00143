<h3>Overview</h3>

The <b>Network Startup Resource Center</b> works directly with the indigenous network engineers and 
operators who develop and maintain 
the Internet infrastructure in their respective countries and regions by providing technical information, 
engineering assistance, training, donations of networking books, equipment and other resources. The 
end goal in this work is to make it easier for local scientists, engineers and educators to collaborate 
via the Internet with their international colleagues by helping to connect communities of interest. 
By strategically working with universities, research institutes, Internet Service Providers, Regional 
Internet Registries, government agencies, supranational agencies, industry, private foundations and 
non-governmental organizations, the NSRC helps develop national and regional Internet infrastructure 
for collaborative research, education, and international partnerships. 

<p>

The roots of the the Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) trace back
to a volunteer effort to support networking in southern Africa in 1988,
when <A HREF="http://psg.com/~randy">Randy Bush</A> designed, taught
about, and helped deploy a multi-country (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, and later many others) network using varying technologies, in
order: <A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=896820010472:489008357/fromPage=ZA">FidoNet
on dialup lines</A>, <A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=898128827821:488960662/fromPage=ZA">UUCP
on dialup lines</A>, <A HREF="lowcost.html">low-cost IP technology </A>
based on 9600 baud and below links using old PCs and publicly available
PC-based SLIP routing software, and finally multiple, dedicated, medium
speed (128-512kb) <A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=896820262105:488982630/fromPage=ZA">links
to the public Internet</A>. 

<p>

<a name="early"></a>
<h3>Early History: 1990's</h3>

In 1991, networkers in Peru asked the NSRC for technical assistance to 
help <A HREF="http://ekeko.rcp.net.pe/index2.htm">connect Peru to the
Internet</A>. With some financial support from UNDP
and Union Latina, the NSRC facilitated the technical work and training
for <A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=897025400829:489015445/fromPage=PE">the
first networking within Peru</A> and to establish the links to the
US. The NSRC was Peru's UUCP link to the outside world for over two years
until Peru was able to upgrade to a 64kb, then 128kb, and then 512kb
<A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=890202524581:497432111/fromPage=PE">satellite 
IP link</A>.

In response to a request from Egyptian network engineers, we provided
technical help to the Egyptian Universities Network to set up <A
HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=898020771119:488981436/fromPage=EG">Egypt's
first link to the Internet</A> in 1993. In 1994, the African Education
division of the World Bank asked the NSRC to help them design a network
in Guinea for electronic mail, as they were having grave problems
communicating within the country. In September 1994, <A
HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=890202303003:497426928/fromPage=GN"> 
we went to Conakry and worked with local folks to set up a system</A> for
PPP within the country, and dial-up UUCP internationally for the country's
first link to the Internet. As there was not a single phone at the
university, we used spread spectrum radio modems within Conakry.

During 1994-95, the NSRC <A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=908226925590:489054571/fromPage=LK">
assisted Sri Lankan engineers</A> to design and deploy <A

Lanka's first TCP/IP link.</A>  Responding to numerous requests from 
networkers in Nairobi, the National Science Foundation supported the
NSRC's work to design, install, and train local engineers for the <A
HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=890202304929:497425105/fromPage=KE">first 
IP links to Kenya</A>. We have worked for several years with Saudi Arabian
academics to help them <A 
HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=890202492267:497433273/fromPage=SA">connect
to the Internet</A>. 

<p>

The NSRC was asked by the US National Academy of Sciences, the
Government of Indonesia, and the World Bank to catalyze and design the
Indonesian academic internet, <A
HREF="http://www.iptek.net.id/">IPTEKnet</A>, which occurred during
1995-96. Also in 1996, we worked with Bill Sangiwa to bring up
<A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=890202327271:497425829/fromPage=TZ">Tanzania's
first connection to the Internet</A>, with assistance from a longtime NSRC
colleague in Lebanon, Nabil Bukhalid, who had experience configuring
Ciscos for IP over X.25 encapsulation.

<p>

In 1997 we <A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=890202324940:497428553/fromPage=TG">assisted
Togo in arranging connectivity</A> for its
first IP link, and collaborated with Togolese engineers to assist
<A HREF="http://www.nsrc.org/db/lookup/operation=lookup-report/ID=904942734056:488973702/fromPage=LR">Liberia</A>
in designing and building its first connection to the Internet. We are
currently working with <A HREF="http://www.uol.co.ug/">Uganda On Line</A>,
the East Africa Help Desk, <A HREF="http://www.makerere.ac.ug/">Makerere
University</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.avumuk.ac.ug/">African Virtual
University</A> project at Makerere to help get more of Uganda's
academics and NGOs on the net.


<P>As networking matures in a country or region and more ISPs develop,
the technical needs shift from obtaining initial IP connectivity to
more complex engineering problems, such as setting up cooperative
eXchange points to keep local traffic local. In June 1997, we were
contacted by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the
Secretariat for Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the República de
Panamá to help set up a neutral exchange point for cooperative use by the
academic network, Red Académica y De Investigación Nacional (PANNet), and
all significant commercial providers. Bush and Dave Meyer trained the
participating Panamanian engineers about BGP, peering points, the Internet
Routing Registry, Autonomous Systems, built the tools to automatate
configuration, and <A HREF="https://rip.psg.com/~randy/970810.intered/"> 
helped set up the InteRed eXchange</A> in July 1997 - the first
open IX in America Latina y el Caribe.

<P>Over the years, the NSRC has provided cost-recovery-only PPP and UUCP
links for academic/research sites and NGOs in South Africa, Taiwan,
Singapore, Thailand, Peru, Belize, Guinea, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Indonesia,
Cambodia, Guatemala, the Comoros Islands, Liberia, and around the
US. In doing so, the NSRC has been careful not to compete with commercial
providers, but has acted as a stepping-stone for these sites,
while assisting them in developing more 'normal' arrangements. 

<P>From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, the Network Startup Resource
Center (via PSGnet) operated FidoNet's international links from North
America to the the rest of the world's regions. Consisting of a few dozen
direct dial-up links to Argentina, Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, the
Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and the UK,
these links essentially bound FidoNet across the globe from the former
USSR, through Europe, the Middle East, North and South America, Oceania,
Africa, and Asia. For a number of years, the NSRC served as a major gate
between FidoNet and the Internet, moving over 3000 messages per day.

<h3>International TCP/IP Training Workshops</h3>
The NSRC collaborated with the Internet Society to create a TCP/IP training workshop for engineers from developing countries, which was held at Stanford University, California in August 1993, and became what is now known globally as the INET workshops. Randy Bush was the the lead instructor for the INET 1993's technical education program, working with Geoff Sears, Steve Fram, Scott Weikart, and many friends in the Internet community. The NSRC also collaborated with ISOC in the planning, organization, and teaching of the University of Hawaii INET workshop in 1995, the McGill University INET workshop in Montreal, Canada in 1996, and INET'98 in Geneva, Switzerland. Since the Stanford workshop, the NSRC has hosted and facilitated a number of mailing lists, which provide a forum for students of <A HREF="/workshops/">TCP/IP workshops</A> in which we've participated with a place to ask questions and seek technical assistance once they've returned home from the training.

<h3>Computing, Networking Equipment and Book Donations</h3>

In many cases, the critical factor preventing a network from becoming
operational, or evolving to the next level, is a single, marginal, piece
of hardware that may be quite inexpensive in the grand scheme of things.
The NSRC coordinates donations of computing and networking hardware by bringing potential recipients and potential donors together.
<p>
In addition technical documentation is often expensive, and difficult to obtain for developing area networks, so we focus on helping build technical libraries
in locations where the resources can be freely shared - academic
departments, university libraries, and centrally-based networking
facilities.

<p>In support of the NSRC's efforts to provide technical documentation to
developing area network operators, <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">Oreilly Media, Inc.</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wiley.com/">Wiley Publishers,</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ciscopress.com/">Cisco Press</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.aw-bc.com/">Addison Wesley and Benjamin Cummings</A>, and
<A HREF="http://vig.prenhall.com/">Prentice Hall</A> have collaborated
with us, and generously donated many books over the past several years.

<P>The NSRC also has good working relationships with numerous ISPs and 
university networks in the US that donate equipment for distribution to
areas in need. Some equipment <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-life-for-network-equipment.html">has been donated directly</a> from companies
such as 3Com, Cisco Systems and Google, Inc. With assistance from the University of Oregon
Computing Center, the NSRC facilitates refurbishing the hardware (if
necessary) and shipping it to academic networks and nascent ISPs in
developing areas.

<p>
From 1992 to 2009, the NSRC has facilitated the distribution of
about $6,000,000 worth of donated technical reference books and
$35,000,000 worth of networking equipment to engineering and computer science
departments, university libraries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
and  networking training facilities in one hundred of the poorest and
least-connected countries in the world. The countries include:
Afghanistan, Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Angola, Azerbaijan,
Bangladesh, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina
Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Comoros Islands,
Congo-Brazzaville, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Djibouti, the Dominican Republic, East Timor, Ecuador, Egypt,
El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana,
Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iraq,
Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, 
Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Mongolia, Morocco,
Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palau, 
Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Russia,
Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands,
South  Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Tajikistan, Tanzania,

<h3>Hosting Network Engineering Interns</h3>

Books and workshops are critical, but hands on experience in larger 
networks gives an engineer operational perspective and confidence which is
not otherwise available by any other means. The NSRC has been doing this
informally over the years, by hosting engineering interns from Argentina,
the Congo (DRC), Ghana, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Kenya, and the results have
been very positive. 
<p>
A typical internship has varied in duration from two weeks to two
months, and consists largely of sitting shoulder to shoulder with peers operating real networks in the US. Examples of past internship activities include:
<ul>
<li>UNIX training</li>
<li>Building BSD systems and SMTP gateways for UUCP and
TCP/IP networks</li>
<li>Designing, building, and configuring a T1 POP</li>
<li>Constructing prototypes of systems to be installed in home country
networks (in the cases of Sri Lanka and Kenya, the actual systems were
built and shipped after the engineers were trained on them)</li>
<li>Touring US university networks, and participating in IETF work meetings</li>
