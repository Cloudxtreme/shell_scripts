	<h3 class="green"><a id="MiekGieben">Miek Gieben</a>, Chain of Trust, 2001</h3>

	The DNS (Domain Name System) is the well-known system that
	takes care of the mapping between domain names and IP numbers
	on the internet.  There are however some security problems
	with DNS, which sparked off the development of DNSSEC (DNS
	SECure).  DNSSEC uses public key cryptography to solve the
	security issues in the DNS.  The goal of DNSSEC is to create a
	chain of trust in which a top level zone (like com) signs the
	key of a lower zone (such as child.com), which in turn can
	sign a even lower zone (a.child.com, for instance).  To set up
	this chain, keys must be exchanged and signatures must be
	renewed on a regular basis.  Further more, keys can be
	discovered, lost or stolen.  This master thesis delves into
	those problems and presents possible solutions and procedures
	for efficient and (reasonably) safe distribution and renewal
	of keys and signatures.

        <h3 class="green"><a id="MartinPels">Martin Pels</a>, DNSSEC Validator, 2004</h3>

        The DNSSEC protocol is capable of checking whether received
	DNS data is authentic and complete.  For this, DNSSEC is using
	three techniques: zone signing (adding a cryptographic
	signature to record sets), creating a chain of trust from a
	trusted point in the DNS tree to the zone that holds the
	requested information, and authenticated denial of existence
	(to guarantee that unacquired information is indeed
	non-existent).
	<br/>
	The DNSSEC client-software consists of four parts: a
	getaddrinfo() library function that coordinates the data
	retrieval, an application that utilizes the function, a
	resolver that retrieves DNS information, and a validator that
	walks down the chain of trust and uses OpenSSL routines to
	check if the gathered information is authentic and complete.
	<br/>
	The software described in this document is a proof of concept
	to show that it is possible to build a resolver/validator of
	this type. It is not to be used by applications on the
	Internet. The software forms a basis for further development
	of DNSSEC client-software by NLnet Labs and other members of
	the open source community that are working on the
	standardisation and implementation of DNSSEC.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="MatthijsMekking">Matthijs Mekking</a>, Formalization and Verification of the Shim6 Protocol, 2007</h3>

	Shim6 provides a scalable solution specific for multihoming
        while minimizing deployment disruption.  Currently, the
        protocol is still in development.  This thesis shows some
        efforts that try to improve the quality of the protocol
        specification. The process of formalization, verification and
        testing are shown to be successful contribution methods.
        Formalization was useful in clarifying the protocol
        specifications.  It revealed some ambiguities and unclarities
        in the draft specification.  Verification also revealed some
        errors.  These issues have been communicated to the authors of
        the Shim6 draft.  They have been acknowledged and adjusted in
        the specification.
	<br/>
	The technique of model checking has been used for
        formalization and verification of the Shim6 protocol. A great
        advantage of model checking is that it is intended to find
        many errors quickly and automatically. The Uppaal model
        checker was used to formalize the Shim6 specifications. Two
        critical parts of Shim6, the context establishment and REAP,
        have been formalized and verified with Uppaal.  This tool
        benefits from its possibility to model timing constraints and
        its rich syntax.  However, model checking has to deal with the
        state space explosion problem. Also, the syntax could still be
        improved with more C-like data types. Furthermore, the
        verification process has shown that the requirement
        specification language is still somewhat primitive.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="MaciekWojciechowski">Maciek Wojciechowski</a>, Border Gateway Protocol Modeling and Simulation, 2008</h3>

	Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is de facto the only
        inter-domain routing protocol of the Internet.  Although the
        protocol is reasonably simple, due to the size of its current
        deployment many anomalies can be observed.  Such anomalies are
        for example very long convergence time or path haunting.  Some
        techniques (e.g., like route flap damping) have been applied
        to tackle the observed problems but they have side-effects
        that were not anticipated before.  There is still a strong
        need for better BGP protocol understanding.
	<br/>
	In this thesis we present a new, ambitious approach to BGP
        simulation.  Instead of focusing on intra-domain
        communication, network and protocol are highly abstracted in
        order to allow for large-scale simulation.  We describe our
        model of the BGP protocol along with its implementation.  The
        implementation is validated in order to show to what extent
        our model resembles the real-world.  Many tracks of future
        research are shown as well as many possible uses of this kind
        of approach to BGP simulation.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="AttillaDeGroot">Attilla de Groot</a>, Implementing OpenLISP with LISP+ALT, 2009</h3>

	Due to the exponential growth of the BGP routing table in the
	&ldquo;default-free-zone&rdquo; the Locator ID Separation
	Protocol (LISP) is being developed.  OpenLISP is one of the
	implementations of this protocol, however it does not have the
	function to route locator and endpoint id addresses.  The
	report describes how a lisp daemon should interact with
	OpenLISP, GRE and Quagga to use LISP+ALT as a control plane.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="ShazaHanif">Shaza Hanif</a>, Impact of Topology on BGP Convergence, 2010</h3>

	For a few decades, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) realized
	Internet to be robust and acceptably stable despite its
	overwhelming growth.  Although it is a fairly simple peer to
	peer protocol, yet because of the scale of Internet at which
	BGP is deployed, it is very difficult to understand behavior
	of BGP.  It is considered a complex task to state what trends
	BGP may show if different internal factors (i.e., routing
	table size, parameter setting at BGP routers etc.) or external
	factors (such as size and shape of network, flow of BGP
	traffic, underlying protocols, performance and capacity of BGP
	routers, etc.) are varied.  In addition certain emergent
	behaviors may only arise when protocol is simulated at
	Internet wide scale.
	<br/>
	We attempt to understand how the underlying topology; one of
	the factors effecting BGP; at which protocol is deployed
	influences BGP performance.  We use a highly scalable
	simulator, capable of simulating current full scale AS-level
	Internet, and give diverse topologies as input to it.  The
	topologies that we use have operational semantics like the
	real Internet.  We found that BGP is sensitive to certain
	topological characteristics of Internet, while remains
	completely unaffected on variation in some other
	characteristics.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="AdrianaSzekeres">Adriana Szekeres</a>, Multi-path Inter-domain Routing, 2011</h3>

	Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical part of the
	Internet, as it is the protocol that keeps the Autonomous
	Systems (ASes) connected.  Despite the fact that it managed to
	scale to the current Internet's size, it also faces other
	problems, one of them being transient disconnectivity during
	convergence time.  In the last years, efforts to solve this
	problem concluded with the proposal of multi-path routing
	protocols.  As their name implies, these protocols are
	designed to explore more paths than BGP in the attempt to keep
	the ASes connected in case of link failures.
	<br/>
	In this thesis we try to shed more light over the multi-path
	routing protocols by conducting experiments that show their
	behavior and impact on BGP.  We focused on three multi-path
	protocols, i.e., R-BGP, YAMR and STAMP, and devised scenarios
	and experiments to show their impact on BGP's scalability,
	stability and resilience to link failures.  Our results show
	that R-BGP outperforms the other two methods, being the only
	one that maintains continuous connectivity during convergence
	time and at the cost of the smallest number of extra BGP
	messages.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="MaikelDeBoer"></a><a id="JeffreyBosma">Maikel de Boer and Jeffrey Bosma</a>, Discovering Path MTU Black Holes on the Internet Using RIPE Atlas, 2012</h3>

	For several reasons (valid or invalid) network middleboxes
	filter ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) and IP fragments.  By
	filtering ICMP PTB packets and IP fragments, Path MTU (PMTU)
	black holes can occur.  The effect of these particular black
	holes in a networked path is that packets, that are larger
	than the smallest link can assimilate, are forever lost
	because of the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of this link.
	Such an event results in a situation where a typical end-user
	thinks is caused by outage of their application, the remote
	service, or the connection in between.
	<br/>
	To determine the scale of the problem and where it occurs we
	have build an experimental setup, and in our experiments use
	RIPE Atlas as a worldwide measurement infrastructure.  We have
	conducted several different experiments using an average 1250
	IPv4 vantage points and an average of 405 IPv6 vantage points.
	The amount of ICMP PTB packet filtering is larger in IPv4 than
	in IPv6, although it is not likely many users will notice any
	problems because of this. The results for IP fragment
	filtering in IPv6 are more troublesome since it is likely that
	protocols like Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
	are not going to work as smoothly on the Internet as it exists
	today. Luckily it looks like the problems do not occur in or
	near the core of the Internet. This means that there is a high
	probability that everyone would be able to fix their own
	networks if these are not configured correctly.

	<h3 class="green"><a id="AleksandarKasabov">Aleksandar Kasabov</a>, Resilient OpenDNSSEC, 2012</h3>

	The operational burden of maintaining encryption keys and
	signed zone files is the main hindrance to deploying (Domain
	Name System Security Extensions) DNSSEC.  Companies try to
	tackle this problem by forcing their administrators to follow
	operational guide books in every step of the daily DNS
	activities.  However, errors are prone to happen in every
	process where the human factor is involved.
	<br/>
	OpenDNSSEC is a turn-key solution for securing DNS zones with
	DNSSEC.  It offers high performance and automatic key
	management.  This project looks at error situations in
	securing DNS zones with OpenDNSSEC and how those can be
	avoided.  The paper also makes recommendations for increasing
	the resilience level which OpenDNSSEC can offer against such
	situations.
