        in the field of Internet.  There is a list of sites which I maintain,
        but also some research work.<BR>

        In 1994, I was working at the <A HREF=http://www.nlr.nl>NLR</A>.
        The NLR is a modern research institute, always willing to try-out new
        technologies.  This is the reason why they responded as fast to the
        newly appearing WWW as they did.  As one of the first companies, they had
        a small web-site, and I got interested in it.</P>
    
        <P>In 1994, I joined Heini Withagen in development of the Internet-site
        DHP: <EM>The Dutch Home Page</EM>.  The
        DHP was the first index for WWW-activities in the Netherlands.  He had
        started the site when there were only 10 sites in total in the Netherlands.
        When that number of listed sites had grown to about 40, he needed help
        which I provided.</P>
    
        <P>For the DHP, I designed web-pages and implemented their automatic
        production.  I left the project after about 4 years (May 1998), when
        over 11,000 sites were listed, and 40,000 lines of C-code and
        shell-script were written.</P></TD></TR>

            with me.  On this site, you can play around with a satellite image
            of Holland.  You can zoom-in on your own house till 20 meter details.
            This popular site has over 2,000,000 zoom-requests already.</TD>

            Computing</A>, my former employer, was designed and implemented by me.
            It is especially complicated by the enormous amount of text
            which needs to be presented friendly; people don't like to
            read, certainly not when it is organized poorly.</TD>

            My home is located in the green and hilly North of town Arnhem
            in The Netherlands (about 135,000 inhabitants, one hour by train
            from Amsterdam).
            My city-quarter breaths the spirit of a village, with more space to
            live, more green, and more social contacts than in the average
            quarter.  An example of these good relations is the
            <a href="http://www.craneveer.nl">Craneveer website</a> (in Dutch only),
            which I built based on someone else's design and existing
            content.</p></TD></TR>

            Having a large family (from my father's side), with loads of
            cousins and cousines traveling and living all around the World,

            brings Linux as central system to primary
            education; much cheaper and more flexible than Windows.
            A full redesign of the existing side was made in 2005,
            although the content needs some refresing as well.</P></TD></TR>
