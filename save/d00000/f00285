You are welcome to look up contact data from abuse.net in abuse analysis
tools that you write or distribute, if you satisify a few simple conditions:
<ul>
<li>The primary support contact you advertise must be the tool's author
or vendor, not abuse.net.
The vast majority of reports we get about misrouted mail sent by automated
tools are due to bugs in the tools rather than erroneous abuse.net listings.</li>
<li>Automatic reports must <i>only</i> be sent based on
the IP address or validated rDNS of the host from which the material in
question arrived at the user's network.</li>

<li>Reports based on anything else must be presented to the user first for
verification, because it is extremely common for tools to misdiagnose
addresses from internal mail headers, forged return addresses, and the like.
Misrouted reports will just make system managers automatically discard
all reports your tool sends.
(It's happened before, many times.)</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
If you wish to use abuse.net in a product or service offered for sale, you
<i>must</i> contact us first to make arrangements.
Examples might include spam filters that look up contact addresses
at abuse.net to send complaints, or a certification service that requires
that clients register with abuse.net.

Programs that analyze spam can use abuse.net to find addresses to which
to send reports, so long as they follow the rules described in the left
column.

<h2>DNS lookup</h2>

The fastest and easiest way to look up abuse.net contact information is
to use our DNS servers.  If you want the contacts for <tt>example.com</tt>,
look up the pseudo-domain
 <blockquote><tt>example.com.contacts.abuse.net</tt></blockquote>

Each TXT record returned will be one of the contacts.
To check if you've gotten all of the contacts, you can also search for an
A record which will tell you how many TXT records there should be (0.0.0.1
for the most common case of one record.)
<br /><br />
It also returns an HINFO record describing the source of the data.
HINFO results include two strings.  The first will be <tt>default</tt>
or <tt>lookup</tt>, depending on whether it found info for the domain
or not.
If it's <tt>lookup</tt>, the second string will be the domain for which
the lookup info was retrieved, which may not be exactly the same as the
domain you looked up.
(For example, if you look up <tt>www.abuse.net</tt> it will return
the lookup results for <tt>abuse.net</tt>.)
There may be more more codes for different kinds of lookups in the future,
but default will always be default.
If you don't need to know where abuse.net got the result, you can
ignore the HINFO record.
<br /><br />
Be sure to direct the lookups to your local DNS cache servers, not to
abuse.net's server, so the cache can remember recent searches and reuse
results.
The standard DNS "time to live" feature ensures that the cache will
not return stale results.

<br /><br />
This snippet of perl code will do the lookup and return an array
containing the contact addresses:
<pre>
# look up contacts from abuse.net
use Net::DNS;
sub ablookup {
    my ($domain) = @_;
    my ($res, $query, @r);

    $res = new Net::DNS::Resolver;
    while(1) {
	$query = $res->search("$domain.contacts.abuse.net", "TXT");
	if ($query) {
	    my $rr;

	    foreach $rr ($query->answer) {
		push @r, $rr->txtdata if $rr->type eq "TXT";
	    }
	    return @r;
	} else { # Net::DNS rejects special characters, strip off
		 # subdomains and see if a parent domain works
	    if($domain =~ m{^[^.]+\.([^.]+\..+)}) {
		$domain = $1;
	    } else {
		die "Cannot lookup contacts for $domain";
	    }
	}
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>WHOIS lookup</h2>

We still support the older WHOIS server, although it is considerably slower
than the new DNS server.
At some point the WHOIS service will go away, so all new and updated
software should use the DNS technique described above.
<br /><br />
To use WHOIS, open a TCP/IP socket to port 43 on <tt>whois.abuse.net</tt>,
and send the name of the domain you want to look up, followed by a
carriage return and line feed.
If you want to look up several domains at once, send them on one line separated
by spaces.
Then read the results back from that socket.
The results will contain one address per line, then a blank line, and the
server will disconnect.
The result lines will usually have a parenthetical comment that you'll need
to remove before using the addresses.
<pre>
abuse@aol.com (for aol.com)
</pre>

<h2>Other techniques</h2>

We don't make copies of the abuse.net database available to build into
tools, so don't ask.  It changes daily, and any copy you had would
instantly be out of date.
The database is not available via BIND zone transfer; the DNS server is
not BIND or anything like it, and there is no zone file.
<br /><br />
Very heavy users (over 100,000 queries per month) may be able to set up
a local mirror of the underlying MySQL database.
If we notice that you're such a user, we'll contact you.
