</p><p>
<H2>Wow, there's a lot of places to look for plane tickets</H2>
</p><p>
The original version of
the FAQ that evolved into this web site
described only one online source of plane reservations (the late, lamented
Easy Sabre) because that's all there was.
Now there are approximately fifteen gazillion web sites selling plane tickets.
But setting up a system to sell tickets is a lot of work, so in reality
most of those web sites funnel into a much smaller number of underlying
systems.
This means that you aren't likely to find a lot more from visiting a hundred
sites than from visiting four or five.
Good sites to start at are
<A HREF="http://www.itasoftware.com" target="link">ITA Software</A>, which uses its own search engine
but doesn't sell tickets, and a couple of the comparison sites such as
<A HREF="http://www.kayak.com" target="link">Kayak</A>.
For more detailed suggestions, see
<a href="airinfo.phtml#howwork"> How do on-line reservations work</a>.
</p><p>
Airlines' own web sites are a notable exception.
Even though they are all backed by one of the standard search systems
(increasingly a customized version of Orbitz), they each provide access
to their own flights without any booking fee.
No matter where you find a ticket, it's worth checking the airline's
own site to see if it's a few dollars less there.
Buying on the airline's own site frequently also makes it easier to pick
seats or change tickets later.
</p><p>
Most sites are intended for relatively casual travellers, not road
warriors who need to know the exact fare class of a ticket, so
they can optimize frequent flyer miles and upgrades.
For access to detailed fare and class availability information, see
Expert Flyer, described later.
It costs money, but if you care about that kind of stuff, it's well worth it.
</p><p>
<H2>The big online agencies</H2>
</p><p>
For domestic US tickets and simple international tickets (e.g., a round trip
from the US to somewhere else, bought at least a month ahead) the big three
are as good a place to start as any.
</p><p>
<b>Note:</b>
American Airlines is currently playing chicken with the agencies in a
dispute about who displays what and how much they pay.
As a result, Expedia and Orbitz currently don't show their routes or sell
their tickets at all. If you're going somewhere that American goes, you
might want to check their site or a neutral search site like
<A HREF="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/" target="link">ITA Software</A> to see if AA has something
worth going to their site to buy.

<H3> Travelocity</H3>
<a name="#travelocity"></a>
<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2175973-10396502" target="_blank">Travelocity</a>
is an online agent owned by Sabre. 
Tickets can be issued as e-tickets or, at extra cost, by mail.  There is
also a great deal of travel destination information of variable usefulness.
Unlike most other web-based systems,
it sometimes lets you hold a reservation without buying it.
Also handles hotels and rental cars.
A nice fare watcher feature lets you list a few routes you're interested
in, and it sends you e-mail when an interesting fare becomes available.
They have a
<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-2175973-10491765" target="_blank">Vacation Deals!</a>
page that often has private fares, two-for-one deals, and the like.
Their flexible search option provides a fare calendar, table of what fares are available on what dates,
that's better than any other site I know.
Unfortunately, just because a fare is available on a date doesn't mean that any actual seats are
available at that fare, so a certain number of the fares are cruel jokes, great bargains if
only the airline would sell you a seat at that fare which they won't.
</p><p>
Some fares are marked "good buy" which means that they're only available
on Travelocity.
But that doesn't mean that they're any cheaper than other fares.
They're waiving the booking fee indefinitely, so their prices should be
the same as you'll find on airline sites.
</p><p>
Travelocity includes a "last minute deals" feature which is a
rebranded version of 
<A HREF="deals.phtml#site59">Site59</A>,
which Travelocity owns.

<H3> Expedia</H3>
<a name="expedia"></a>
<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-2176004-10517730" target="_top">Expedia</a>
was Microsoft's flashy entrant into the web travel biz.
In July 2001 they sold a controlling interest to USA Networks, owner
of Home Shopping Network and other great cultural monuments.
In August 2003, the two companies were merged under the extremely trendy
name of IAC/InterActive Corp, along with hotels.com, Match.com and
LendingTree.
In 2005 they admitted that synergy is just a buzzword and spun it off as
a separate company.
It still has that Microsoft feel.
The site is a bit noisy, but it's reasonably easy to
negotiate and to find schedules and fares.
You have to provide a credit card number to make a reservation,
even if you don't want to buy immediately.
Early on, when I tried to reserve, it said it the credit card link was down, no reservations
possible, call a number in Florida if it's urgent.  Yeah, right.
(At Microsoft, quality is job 1.1.)
It seems to work better now.
There's also lots of promos and tie-ins, with Expedia-only special fares.
You can sign up for weekly e-mail about best fares on routes you select.
They're waiving the booking fee indefinitely, so their prices should be
the same as you'll find on airline sites.

<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=136622.10000008&type=3&subid=0" >Orbitz</a>
was intended to be the "killer" airline ticket web site.
Founded by United, Northwest, Continental, Delta, and American, it was sold in
October 2004 to Cendant, a large travel company that owns Avis rent-a-car and Ramada Inns
and dozens of other familiar chains, then in July 2007
was spun off as a standalone company along with some smaller travel companies
that Cendant bought along the way.
At least 30 airlines including the founders are Orbitz charter affiliates, which means they give
all of their web fares to Orbitz.
It has a very nice lowest fare search engine.
You can tell it to add alternate airport within 70 miles,
and it gives you the possible routings, cheapest first.
It now lets you
give a range of dates, or say that you want to take a weekend trip in
a particular month, and it gives you a grid showing the lowest available
fare for each combination of departure and return dates.
They promise unbiased fare and schedule listings, and have agreements
with affiliate airlines to include all publicly available fares (a term
that is harder to define than it looks) such as web specials.
Their search engine does a more thorough job than others (it runs on racks of cheap PCs
rather than on expensive mainframe computers)
so it'll often find fares and connections that are entirely
valid but not shown on other systems.
For domestic US tickets on the airlines they include,
they're hard to beat, although like other online agencies, they don't include Southwest.
For international tickets, particularly on anything more complex than a
round-trip, they can be very hit and miss.
Try building your trip one leg at a time and watch the price zoom up and
down.
They also have some spiffy customer service, e.g., they can call you or send
a text message to your mobile phone or PDA
a few hours before flight time to tell you your gate and
whether there are delays.
They're waiving the booking fee indefinitely on tickets where all legs are
on the same airline, so their prices should be
the same as you'll find on airline sites.

is owned by nine European airlines and the Amadeus GDS.
Its coverage of the European majors is good, but keep in mind that on
many European routes you can find something cheaper on
a low-cost airline that doesn't participate with Amadeus.
(See Fare Searches below to find services link to the airlines that
Opodo doesn't.)
It's intended for European audiences although anyone can use it,
so tickets are priced in pounds or euros.
</p><p>
Opodo's user registration is, ah, challenging; no matter what I
do, it insists I have entered an unknown user or password or the
e-mail address for password recovery doesn't match the user name, even
though I copied them from confirmation messages that Opodo just sent.
So buy tickets without registering.

<H3> Apollo systems</H3>
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.itn.net" target="link">Internet Travel Network</A> is now part of American
Express.
It's a WWW-based flight
booking system. You make reservations, using Apollo, which are then
ticketed by American Express, unless you entered via another agency's
web site.
Several other sites on the net including several airlines
have ``private label''
connections to ITN, but it's the same system, usually just with slightly
different screen backgrounds and titles.
The base ITN system uses data from Apollo, but apparently some of the private
label versions use other CRS.
</p><p>
<A NAME="worldspan"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.worldspan.com" target="link">Worldspan</A> is another large international CRS.
They provide a Web availability and pricing system, which underlies the
web sites of participating agents as well as the Delta and Northwest web
sites, only available via customer sites, not on their own site.
It's the system that underlies
<A HREF="#expedia">Expedia</A> and to some extent <A HREF="#orbitz">Orbitz</a>
Galileo's owner Travelport is in the process of buying Worldspan and will
presumably merge the two.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.cheaptickets.com" target="link">Cheap Tickets</A> originally sold mostly cheap
tickets to Hawaii, but is now a general purpose online agent.
I gather that unlike most other web sites, the live agents at their 800
number have access to fares not on the web site and often not available
through other sites.  Owned by Cendant, being spun off in the same
travel company as Orbitz,
although the sites remain separate.
</p><p>
<H3> Amadeus</H3>
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.amadeus.net/" target="link">AmadeusLink</A>,
was started in 1987 by four European airlines and in 1995
absorbed System One
which started a long time ago as Eastern Airlines' reservation system.
They offer extensive schedule and availability info, along with rental
car, hotel, and destination info.
For bookings, you need to use a subscribing travel agency, such as
Opodo, or a site built on their AmadeusLink system.
The AmadeusLink booking systems all link into the same site, so other than some of the
graphics, the function they provide is identical.
</p><p>
<H2>Meta-searches</H2>
</p><p>
A meta-search looks at lots of other sites and gives you a combined result
that is supposed to have the lowest fare.
All of these work, but in each case it appears that they only search sites
that will pay them a commission.
The commission doesn't affect your fare, but it does mean that there are
other sites that might have lower fares that they don't search.
In particular, you'll never find
low-price airlines like Southwest and Ryanair.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.hipmunk.com/" target="link">Hipmunk</A> is ain interesting approach to
flight search using what they call an "agony index" that trades off
price, length of flight time of day and other factors.  The display
is time bars similar to ITA's, but sorted differently and with
slightly different options like no red-eyes.  They don't
sell tickets, but link to Orbitz or the airlines once you've selected
your flights.  It's an interesting idea, although my agony index
(I hate red-eyes and tight seating but don't mind a connection so long
as there's an airline club I can use) appears rather different from theirs.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.mobissimo.com/" target="link">Mobissimo</A> is a
meta-search that searches lots of other web sites for a
pair of cities and dates and shows you what fares it found.
</p><p>
<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=100094.10000005&type=3&subid=0" >Kayak</a>
and Sidestep are meta-searches,
systems that search multiple airline web sites to make
a combined listing with links you can
click through to the various sites to buy.
They work well, but as with all combo sites, there are usually interesting
sites they don't search so you still have to look for yourself.
They were originally separate competing sites but the companies merged.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.pricegrabber.com/home_travel.php" target="link">Pricegrabber</A> offers price
comparisons of everything from computer parts to hotels, now including
plane tickets.
It's pretty slick, but the list of places they search seems limited.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.farecompare.com" target="link">Fare compare</A> isn't really a meta-search;
it takes fare information directly from the airlines to let you find the
cheapest dates on routes of interest.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.yapta.com" target="link">Yapta</A> checks airline web sites to see if the fare
for trips of interest has dropped since the last time you checked.  Much
of the functionality is bundled into a very intrusive browser plugin that
I haven't tried.
</p><p>
<H2>Other general sites</H2>
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.onetravel.com" target="link">OneTravel</A> offers booking and ticketing.
They used to have
a "fare beater" feature with negotiated and "white label" fares,
but it's gone. Too bad.
It's a competent but ordinary online agent now.
<A HREF="http://www.cheapseats.com" target="link">Cheapseats</A> is another portal into the same system.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.travelweb.com" target="link">Travelweb</A>, also known as
<A HREF="http://www.lowestfare.com" target="link">Lowestfare</A>, is a subsidiary of Priceline.
It offers the usual array of tickets, with lots of links to Priceline.
</p><p>
<H2>Fare searches and comparisons</H2>
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/cvg/dispatch" target="link">ITA Software</A> builds the
search engine used by Orbitz and an increasing number of airline sites,
and you can use a copy of the latest version of their search system.
No booking, you have to take what you find and book elsewhere. 
It's by far my favorite tool to explore what's available when, keeping
in mind that it can't see low fare airlines not in the GDS that provide
its data.
Google has bought ITA, but they don't seem likely to make big changes to what
ITA provides.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.qixo.com" target="link">Qixo</A> searches two dozen airline sites and returns a
combined list of the lowest fares found for route.
If you book through them, there's a $20 booking fee, but of course
once you know the airline and times,
there's nothing keeping you from booking up the same flights on another
site.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://travel.yahoo.com" target="link">Yahoo Travel</A> offers fare calendar searches using
Travelocity's engine; you
give it two cities and it helps you find the lowest fares and the dates on

do searches anywhere.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.airninja.com/" target="link">Air Ninja</A> offers a good directory of low-fare
airlines that don't sell through the usual online agencies.  You tell it

<A HREF="http://www.CheapFlights.com" target="link">Cheap Flights USA</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.CheapFlights.co.uk" target="link">Cheap Flights UK</A>
offers a nice search engine
for low cost tickets from the US and UK, many of which don't appear
in the major search engines.
Not a travel agency, they link to other agents and airlines where they
presumably collect a referral fee (which is fine, it doesn't affect
the price of the ticket.)
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.foundem.com/search/flightsUK.jsp" target="link">Foundem</A> searches
multiple sites in the UK. Supposed to include both regular agent sites

</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.skyscanner.net" target="link">Sky Scanner</A> offers an excellent search
engine for cheap flights within the UK and Europe.  Don't miss their

</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.flightatlas.com/" target="link">Flight Atlas</A> offers cute animated maps showing

<A HREF="http://www.airtreks.com" target="link">AirTreks</A> has a spiffy web site that helps construct
and price multi-stop and round-the-world international travel.
They're a travel agency, the site estimates the price, exact prices and
tickets come from live agents at the agency.
(That's what you want, no computer can navigate the swamp of international
routes and fares very well.)
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.farepoint.co.uk/" target="link">Farepoint</A> provides a large database of

They claim the prices they offer are the best available.
For routes within the US they act as a front end to flifo.
One reader reports a bad experience with their US agent, rebooking his
reservation in a way that lost the discount fare he'd reserved, although
he'd had good results with their UK agent.

<A HREF="http://www.farecast.com/" target="link">Farecast</A> attempts to predict future airfares
so you can pick the best time to buy your tickets.
Their list of cities, originally only Boston and Seattle, has expanded to a
modest list of domestic airports, so if they happen to cover your favorite

</p><p>
<H2>Detailed fares and availability</H2>

<A HREF="http://www.expertflyer.com" target="link">Expert Flyer</A> provides detailed seat and
fare availability information, similar to what a travel agent sees.
Five day free trial, then limited access for $5/mo, full access for $10/mo.
If you fly a lot, it's invaluable for finding which flights have seat
upgrades available, which ones have seats at particular fares, and other
detailed info for finding the exact flights one wants.

No maps, but lots of data.
</p><p>
<H2>Itinerary Lookup</H2>
</p><p>
Each of the GDS has a web site where you can look
up the details of the record for a reservation
if you have the locator code, generally
a sequence of six letters or digits, and the passenger's last name.
A single trip can have information on more than one system.  For example,
if you make a United Airlines reservation on Travelocity, the main
Travelocity record is on Sabre, but there's a copy on United's home
system Galileo, as well.  Each system has a different locator code, and
it can be hard to find the codes for other than the original system.
Virtually There sometimes shows the locator for other system records as
the Confirmation field, although you have to figure out or guess
which system it's on.
</p><p>
Every travel agent except Orbitz uses one of the GDS to make its
reservations so the master record for each trip is available through
one of the systems.
The online systems usually show the locator code on one of the
confirmation screens, and any airline or local travel agent will tell your
the locator for your reservation if you ask.
Since Orbitz uses its direct connect technology to make reservations
directly with many airlines, the master record is on Orbitz itself and
as far as I can tell you can't tell the airline's locator until you get
your boarding pass.
</p><p>
<A HREF="https://www.virtuallythere.com" target="link">Virtually There</A> can show records from
Sabre inclding reservations on Travelocity.
</p><p>
<A HREF="https://www.checkmytrip.com" target="link">Check My Trip</A> can show records from Amadeus,
including reservations on many European airlines.
</p><p>
<A HREF="https://www.viewtrip.com/en-us/ViewTrip.asp" target="link">View Trip</A> can show records from Galileo,
including reservations on United.
</p><p>
Some of these systems will also show rental car and hotel info if they're
included in the same records.
