    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions about Tarsnap</h3>
    <div class="boxcontents">
      <h4>I tried to register but I never received the
	confirmation email.  What's wrong?</h4>
      <p>
	It's probably stuck in a spam filter somewhere.  Tarsnap sends email
	via <a href="http://www.sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>, which is usually
	successful in delivering email (more so than when Tarsnap mail was
	sent directly, at least); but convincing everyone to accept email from
	you is incredibly difficult these days.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you can't convince your spam filters to let Tarsnap email through,
	try registering from an email address at a different domain.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="DEDUPE">If Tarsnap costs $0.30 / GB of storage, how is it
	possible to store "archives adding up to several terabytes" while
	paying less than $10/month?</h4>
      <p>
	Tarsnap automatically "deduplicates" &mdash; that is, identifies and
	removes duplicate blocks of data &mdash; from the archives it stores.
	While any one archive will usually not contain many copies of the same
	data (although there are exceptions, e.g., software developers with
	multiple check-outs of different source code trees), it is very common
	to have several archives created at different times which share a lot
	of their contents.
      </p>
      <p>
	For example, one of the tarsnap.com servers recently printed the
	following from its hourly backup run (via the <tt>--print-stats</tt>
	option):
      </p>
      <pre>                                       Total size  Compressed size
All archives                       17681167861052    4480261572891
  (unique data)                       13834332132       3264046263
This archive                           2704794761        623975240
New data                                  1378882           332909</pre>
      <p>
	This server has over 6,000 archives stored &mdash; hourly backups for
	over 8 months &mdash; which add up to a total of 17.7 TB; but after
	duplicate blocks of data are removed (or more precisely, only stored
	once), that drops to 13.8 GB, which is then compressed to 3.3 GB
	&mdash; an amount which costs less than $1/month to store.
      </p>
      <h4>I've been using Tarsnap for a few hours, but I
	can't see any usage shown on the web interface.  What's going on?</h4>
      <p>
	All Tarsnap accounting is currently done daily at approximately
	midnight UTC.  Wait until after that point and your usage should be
	visible.  (Payments made should show up immediately, however).
      </p>
      <h4>What happens when my account runs out of money?</h4>
      <p>
	You will be sent an email when your account balance falls below 7 days
	worth of storage costs warning you that you should probably add more
	money to your account soon.  If your account balance falls below
	zero, you will lose access to Tarsnap, an email will be sent to inform
	you of this, and a 7 day countdown will start; if your account
	balance is still below zero after 7 days, it will be deleted along
	with the data you have stored.
      </p>
      <h4>Why did my daily storage usage cost change when I haven't uploaded
	or deleted any data?</h4>
      <p>
	Tarsnap's storage cost is priced per month, and different months have
	different numbers of days.
      </p>
      <h4>Is Tarsnap storage reliable?</h4>
      <p>
	Yes.  Data archived via Tarsnap is stored on the
	<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> storage service
	(the original version, not the new "reduced redundancy" version).
      </p>
      <h4>Why doesn't Tarsnap <tt>--list-archives</tt> print archives in
	alphabetical (or chronological) order?</h4>
      <p>
	The archive metadata which contains Tarsnap archive names and
	creation times is encrypted; so it's impossible for the Tarsnap
	client code to figure out in what order the archives should be listed
	until it downloads and decrypts the metadata.  Once it has done so,
	it might as well just print out the information immediately &mdash;
	if you want a particular order, <tt>sort(1)</tt> is your friend.
      </p>
      <h4>Have you considered accepting bitcoins as payment?</h4>
      <p>
	Yes, I have considered it.  No, I don't plan on accepting them in the
	near future.  While bitcoins seem to be based on a firm footing as far
	as security is concerned, I'm rather dubious about the economics; it's
	hard to see how a currency which is designed to be deflationary can
	achieve any sort of stable value.
      </p>
      <p>
	If and when the value of bitcoins stabilizes, I'll reconsider them;
	but as long as the value is changing so rapidly, accepting bitcoins
	would be too much of a headache.
      </p>
      <h4>Does Tarsnap run on Windows?</h4>
      <p>
	Only via Cygwin.
      </p>
      <h4>I've forgotten my password; how can I reset it?</h4>
      <p>
	Please <a href="contact.html">contact the author</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>I've lost the key file for a machine; how can I delete its data so
	that I'm not stuck paying for it forever?</h4>
      <p>
	Please <a href="contact.html">contact the author</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>How can I do X?</h4>
      <p>
	Please <a href="contact.html">contact the author</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Why isn't my question listed here?</h4>
      <p>
	Either it isn't asked frequently enough, or it was forgotten when
	this page was written.  Please <a href="contact.html">contact the
	author</a>.
