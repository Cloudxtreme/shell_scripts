<h5><em>Mean field equilibrium for dynamic games</em></h5>
<p>Engineers working on the kinds of large scale ecosystems described
above have an inadequate collection of tools with which to understand
dynamic interactions of self-interested agents. This is a serious
limitation: to design, manage, and operate engineered ecosystems, we
need tools that allow us to understand how they will react dynamically
to changes in design parameters (e.g., market rules). Dynamic game
theory provides the most natural methodology to employ. However,
existing models of dynamic games are generally computationally
intractable for large systems, and often place implausible demands on
the rationality of players--leading to a lack of structural insight.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>These challenges have spurred renewed recent interest in an
approximation methodology for dynamic games that we term mean field
equilibrium (MFE). In MFE, each player reacts to only the long run
average state of other players; this approximation is inspired by a
limit where the number of players grows large.  This construction
simplifies both computational and rationality requirements.  
</p>
<p class='vspace'>In the first paper below, we study a general model of stochastic
dynamic games with many players over unbounded state spaces. We
provide conditions for existence of MFE, and show that under the same
conditions MFE approximates equilibria well in games with a large
finite number of players. These conditions naturally provide insight
into accuracy of MFE in a wide range of applications, from oligopolies
to resource allocation.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>In the second paper below, we study games with strategic
complementarities, used to model a diverse set of
applications—including network security models, recommender systems,
and dynamic search in markets. We show that players converge to MFE
via natural myopic learning dynamics that are akin to model predictive
control or receding horizon control; as we argue, these dynamics are
more reasonable than the standard best response dynamics. We also
quantify how the equilibria of such games move in response to changes
in parameters of the game.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>We are currently employing MFE in a range of settings, including queueing games, multiarmed bandit games, and dynamic market games.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><em>A note on terminology</em>: The second paper uses the term "mean field
equilibrium" as this is quite common in the control literature.
However for the applications considered in the first paper,
"stationary equilibrium" is more common terminology, and so we have
followed suit.

</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h5><em>Information and efficiency in dynamic markets</em></h5>
<p>Recently I have become increasingly interested in understanding how a
diverse collection of markets perform over time, both in aggregating
the private information of market participants, and in efficiently
allocating goods among them.  My interest is in studying mechanisms
widely used in practice (such as repeated generalized second price
auctions in sponsored search settings, or limit order books and
specialist markets for trading of financial securities), with a view
towards obtaining structural insight that can guide the engineering of
such markets.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Our work in the first paper below details conditions under which
dynamic markets guarantee both informational and allocative
efficiency.  We develop a simple condition on a market, that we refer
to as <em>asymptotic smoothness</em>, under which nonpathological
equilibria of a market are eventually efficient.  This condition is
qualitatively interesting, because it reveals that narrowing of
bid-ask spreads over time is essentially sufficient for efficiency,
and in particular suggests that we search for market mechanisms that
can guarantee this property (as is the case in algorithmic markets
used for prediction purposes).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>More recently, we have been applying mean field equilibrium (see
above) to the analysis of dynamic markets.  In particular, we have
begun studying how bidders learn their valuations in repeated
auctions, inspired by settings such as sponsored search.  Using a mean
field approach, we obtain a structural characterization of the value
bidders place on learning; the resulting equilibrium provides insight
into the relationship between true valuations and observed bids.
(This work is in preparation.)

</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h3>Past projects:</h3>
<h5><em>Designing efficient P2P systems</em></h5>
<p>In this work we start with the observation that most peer-to-peer
(P2P) system designs essentially induce an exchange economy, where
agents are able to download content in return for uploading. With this
abstraction in hand, we consider a fundamental tradeoff: while
multilateral, virtual currency-based system designs are efficient,
they lack the implementation simplicity of bilateral, barter-based
protocols (like BitTorrent). In this way the design of an efficient
P2P ecosystem becomes a referendum on the efficiency and complexity of
maintaining a currency. We consider the implications of building an
entire peer-to- peer system around a virtual currency. Our theoretical
and empirical results provide quantitative insight into regimes where
bilateral exchange may perform quite well, even if it does not always
give rise to Pareto-efficient equilibrium allocations.

</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h5><em>Markets for resource allocation</em></h5>
<p>What "simple" market mechanisms ensure reasonably efficient resource
allocation, despite self-interested users?  In a range of work, I have
considered the basic problem of allocating a fixed amount of an
infinitely divisible resource among multiple competing, fully rational
users, using market mechanisms with scalar strategy spaces; this
continues earlier work in my Ph.D. thesis.  Our work in the paper below
characterizes the optimal mechanism among those that set one per-unit
price (shown to be Kelly's proportional allocation mechanism), and
those that set different per-unit prices for each user (shown to be a
scalar variant of the well known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves class). Taken
together, we discuss how our results quantify a fundamental insight in
mechanism design: when the pricing flexibility available to the
mechanism designer is limited, restricting the strategic flexibility
of bidders may actually <em>improve</em> the efficiency guarantee.

</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h5><em>Autonomy vs. stability in interdomain routing</em></h5>
<p>The Internet consists of thousands of autonomous systems (ASes) that
cooperate and compete to provide the global fabric of connectivity
that supports billions of users.  ASes require <em>autonomy</em>, i.e.,
flexibility in specifying their own routing policies to dictate where
packets traversing their networks should flow; these policies are set
to meet contractual obligations. At the same time, this autonomy may
lead to a lack of <em>stability</em> in the overall inter-AS routing
system.  In this work we investigated the tension between autonomy and
stability: in particular, we prove a type of routing "impossibility
theorem" that shows that maintaining stability limits providers to
(essentially) adopt shortest hop-count routing as their policy.

(An  earlier version appeared at ACM SIGCOMM 2005.)
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h5><em>Inefficiency of route optimization</em></h5>
<p>In a related line of work, we investigate the efficiency implications
of simultaneous route optimization decisions by different autonomous systems (e.g.,
ISPs and content distribution networks). We find a form of ''Braess'
paradox'' that emerges: individual parties’ attempts to balance load
may leave everyone worse off than if they had been entirely passive in
their routing policy. Such effects can be mitigated by providing the
correct inter-AS congestion signals as part of the infrastructure.

</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h5><em>Externalities in services</em></h5>
<p>Several pieces of my prior work have focused on the role of
externalities in service provision.  In the first paper below, we study a game
among providers who invest to mitigate the <em>congestion effect</em> felt
by end users, and set a per-unit price for their resources. Our
analysis reveals that the structure of the congestion 
externality has a first order impact on whether the resulting market is "concentrated" or
competitive. We provide a comprehensive analysis, including a discussion of existence,
uniqueness, and efficiency of equilibria.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>On the other hand, note that the preceding results are in a model with a pure
congestion effect among the users. In reality, however, many networked services create
network effects as well: e.g., in virtual communities or online gaming environments, users
derive benefit from being able to reach each other. We characterize the tradeoff between
these effects in the second paper below, and study operational consequences for the service provider.

</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h5><em>Reputation system design</em></h5>
<p>I have also been interested in the evolution of reputation in online
ecosystems, particularly marketplaces such as eBay. A reputation
mechanism provides a vehicle for buyers to determine whether they
trust a seller by aggregating past behavior of a seller. These reduced
statistics give prospective buyers an indicator of
trustworthiness. Our work shows an important tradeoff: we show
that mechanisms that use information from a larger number of past
transactions tend to provide incentives for patient sellers to be more
truthful, but for higher quality sellers to be less
truthful. Depending on the mix of sellers in the marketplace, this
type of insight provides guidance into the window sizes that are most
likely to lead to efficient trade among participants.
