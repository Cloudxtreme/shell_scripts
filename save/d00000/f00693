<p>Thank you for your interest in joining the Virtual Private Network
Consortium, better known as VPNC. VPNC is the trade association for the
international VPN vendor community.  The VPNC has been in existence since
1999 and our membership is continually growing.

<h1>Purposes for VPNC</h1>

<p>The primary purposes of the VPNC are:

<ul>

<li>Promote the products of its members to the press and to potential
customers

<li> Increase interoperability between members to help them better serve
their potential customers

<li>Serve as the forum for the VPN manufacturers throughout the world

<li>Help the press and potential customers understand VPN technologies and
standards

</ul>

It should be noted that VPNC will not create standards; instead, it
will strongly support the current and future IETF standards.

<h1>Benefits of Membership</h1>

<p>The tangible benefits of VPNC membership include:

<ul>

<li>Members receive significant exposure by being included on multiple pages
of the VPNC website, which averages over 100,000 visits per week. These
pages include:

<ul compact>

<li>Members' List with direct links to the product information on members'
sites.

<li>Technical Features list for members' products. This will allow the
press, when writing on a particular feature or set of features, to find
which members' products to describe.

<li>Interoperability Testing page which lists which products, including
version, have passed each test, the testing criteria and the specific setup
for the listed product so that successful results can be duplicated by
customers.

<li>Technical White Papers which give members the opportunity to educate the
larger VPN community about their specific technologies.

</ul>

<li>Low cost interoperability testing for our IPsec and SSL members. There
is a one-time only lab fee of $1,000 per product/product line.  This is for
the life of your product and includes tests we currently offer as well as
ones we will add in the future.  We also encourage our members to retest new
revisions to better serve the VPN buying community, and there are no
additional fees.  This testing is optional but is only available to members.

<li>Active marketing outreach to the press and VPN community, which includes
prospective customers, to communicate the successful interoperability
testing results.  Members' products are included on the VPNC website testing
pages with detailed information; results for testing and re-testing are
announced in the VPNC monthly electronic newsletter, the VPNC Update.

<li>Testing certification logos for products that successfully complete any
of the interoperability tests.  Members are welcome to use these logos to
support their own marketing strategies (e.g., website, product literature,
etc.) for as long as the company remains in the VPNC.

<li>Additional marketing exposure with inclusion in the VPNC Update, a
monthly electronic newsletter which is distributed to a targeted audience
including the security press, IT managers and other VPN-related companies.
As mentioned above, we announce successful testing and re-testing results. 
We also include relevant press releases that our members issue each month
with a link directly to the member's site.

<li>Discussions among the members of topics such as how to classify
the different types of VPNs, what kind of interoperability
certification should be available in the VPN market, and other
industry-specific issues.

</ul>

<p>In addition to the member-specific, tangible benefits, VPNC will offer
many services to the general Internet community which can be thought of as
intangible benefits for members. These include:

<ul>

<li>Logistics support for VPN interoperability events, such as mailing lists
and announcements on the VPNC web pages.

<li>Support for the IETF technical work, such as a better archive for the
IPsec mailing list.

<li>Content on the VPNC web site which helps the press and potential
customers understand the features of VPNs, particularly technical issues. In
addition to creating this content ourselves, we can point to other web sites
(particularly those of the trade press) that contain good articles and other
material.

<li>Paul Hoffman, the VPNC director, has regular conversations with the
security press writing about VPN-related issues.  He also attends
conferences, gives presentations and participates on panels throughout the
year.

</ul>

<h1>Member Companies</h1>

<p>Membership in VPNC is limited to companies in the VPN market. This
includes hardware manufacturers, software manufacturers, and service
providers of the protocols supported as VPNs by VPNC: IPsec, L2TP under
IPsec, SSL-based VPNs, and MPLS-based VPNs. VPNC is a nonprofit (501(c)(6))
corporation.

<h1>Logistics</h1>

<p>Membership dues are $4,000 per year per company. Each company has at
least two representatives, one responsible for marketing communications, the
other for technical communications. You are welcome to designate separate
marketing and technical contacts for the IPsec, MPLS, and SSL aspects of
your company. Anyone working for a member company can be on any VPNC
members-only mailing list.

<p>VPNC offers a low cost interoperability testing program to our IPsec and
SSL members.  Certification logos are available once a product successfully
completes any of the tests.  There is a one-time lab fee of $1,000 per
product/product line tested.  This is for the life of the product and
includes any additional tests that will be added to the testing lab in the
future as well as re-testing for subsequent revisions, which we encourage
our members to do.  It should be noted that the list of products which
interoperate continues to grow as we test each product that is currently in
the VPNC lab with every new product that is added.


<h1>Your Next Step</h1>
