<img src="img/business_h4_01.gif" alt="What is IX" width="510" height="22" />
</h4>
<p>IX is an internet exchange service for the purpose of providing  peer-to-peer connection between networks of internet service providers  (ISP). IX fulfills the role of supporting the backbone of the internet  through providing an economical peer-to-peer connection between ISP's  instead of having to go through unnecessary relays. In order to make  this peer-to-peer connection, JPIX provides IX ports according to the  amount of connection traffic of the ISP's.</p>
<h4>
<img src="img/business_h4_02.gif" alt="Merits connecting to IX" width="510" height="22" />
</h4>
<p>Due to the "broadband era," every ISP and webhosting company is facing  the necessity of strengthening its backbone network. On the other hand,  a backward phenomenon is occurring in that income from the end user is  insufficient for the cost of strengthening their backbone. In such  situations, IX provides an economical traffic exchange environment  where ISP's can directly connect to each other.</p>
<h4>
<img src="img/business_h4_03.gif" alt="Things you should know before connecting to IX" width="510" height="22" />
</h4>
<p>The following are things you should know for connecting to IX.</p>
<h5>
<img src="img/business_h5_01.gif" alt="BGP4,AS number" width="510" height="25" />
</h5>
<p>The IX service JPIX provides is a "Layer 2 Service." JPIX members could  be required to exchange their routing information among each other. The  protocol to be used for this exchange will be the BGP4 (Border Gateway  Protocol version 4). In order to distinguish ISP's within this  transaction as exchanging routing information, an AS number (Autonomous  System) is required, so you will need to obtain one to use the service.  The JPNIC (Japan Network Information Center) manages the allocation on  of the AS number in Japan, so please contact them for instructions on  how to obtain one. In regards to consultation on managing a BGP4  protocol, JPIX can introduce companies that can provide such  consultation.</p>
<h5>
<img src="img/business_h5_02.gif" alt="Peering Negotiation" width="510" height="25" />
</h5>
<p>Under the "Layer 2 Service," solely connecting to the IX port will not  enable the flow of traffic. There is a need to make necessary setups  for exchanging each other's routing information on their connected  router. This is called "peering" and you cannot automatically peer all  of the JPIX members. You will need to make a "peering negotiation" with  the members you wish to peer beforehand. After negotiating and getting  approval from other members you wish to connect to, you will set the  respective routers to accomplish the connection. In any case, JPIX does  not support any "peering negotiation" or "peering policy (the agreement  on peering, pricing policies, etc.)." This will be taken care of by  each member.</p>
<h5>
<img src="img/business_h5_03.gif" alt="MLPA" width="510" height="25" />
</h5>
<p>The MLPA (Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement) is provided for those who  wish to peer with anybody. Under this agreement, MLPA members can  basically connect to other MLPA members. At present, there are 20 companies registered under this agreement.</p>
