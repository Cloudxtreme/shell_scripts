    <div class="boxcontents">
      <p>
	This is a legal agreement between the person registering for a
	Tarsnap account ("You" or "you") and Tarsnap Backup Inc. ("I" or "me").
	This agreement governs your use of the Tarsnap service ("the
	service").
      </p>
      <h4>Client code</h4>
      <p>
	1. You may only access the service using unmodified Tarsnap client
	code which I have distributed.  Compiling the source code to produce
	binaries does not constitute "modification" for the purpose of this
	clause.
	<a href="legal-why.html#UNMODIFIEDCLIENT" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	2. You may use the Tarsnap client code for the sole purpose of
	accessing the service.
      </p>
      <h4>Privacy</h4>
      <p>
	3. I may send you email concerning the service or your account at any
	time.
      </p>
      <p>
	4. I will not sell your email address to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
	5. I may provide information concerning your account and your use of 
	the service to 3rd parties, at my sole discretion, if
      </p>
      <ul><li>
	It is requested by law enforcement authorities.
	<a href="legal-why.html#PRIVACYLAW" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </li><li>
	I have reason to believe that it is in your interest that I provide
	such information.
	<a href="legal-why.html#PRIVACYINTEREST" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </li><li>
	It is necessary in order to keep the service running, or to diagnose
	or fix problems with the service or another network.
	<a href="legal-why.html#PRIVACYNETWORKADMIN" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </li></ul>
      <h4>Money</h4>
      <p>
	6. In order to use the service, you must deposit money into your
	account in advance.  Each payment must be a minimum of $5.
	<a href="legal-why.html#PAYMENTINADVANCE" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	7. When you use the service, money will be deducted from your account
	at a rate of 300 picodollars per byte-month of compressed storage
	used ($0.30 per billion bytes per month) and 300 picodollars
	<a href="picoUSD-why.html" target="_blank">[Why picodollars?]</a>
	per byte of incoming and outgoing bandwidth ($0.30 per billion bytes)
	measured at the TCP layer.
	<a href="GB-why.html" target="_blank">[Why 10^9 instead of 2^30?]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	7. (a) The word "dollars" means US dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
	7. (b) The above price includes GST/HST for residents of Canada outside
	of British Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>
	7. (c) Notwithstanding the above, the price for residents of British
	Columbia is 267.857143 picodollars (per byte-month of storage or byte
	of bandwidth usage) plus tax, instead of 300 picodollars.
	<a href="legal-why.html#BCPSTISSTUPID" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	8. You are responsible for any use of your account; consequently, you
	are responsible for keeping your account password and the keys you use
	to access the service secure.
      </p>
      <p>
	9. If your account balance drops below zero, you will no longer be
	able to access the service, and any data you have stored using the
	service may be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
	10. At any point, you may ask for a refund of your remaining account
	balance by contacting me at
	<a href="mailto:cperciva@tarsnap.com?subject=Close%20Account">cperciva@tarsnap.com</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
      <p>
	11. Use of the service is at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>
	THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, 
	INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
	IN NO EVENT SHALL I BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
	SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
	LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE,
	DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
	THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
	(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
	OF THIS SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
      </p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>
	12. This agreement will be governed by the laws of British Columbia,
	Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
	13. If you are a resident of Canada, you must provide me with your
	name and mailing address.
	<a href="legal-why.html#CANADIANADDRESS" target="_blank">[Why?]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	14. I may update these Terms and Conditions at any time, but you will
	not be bound by any updates until 30 days after I send you an email
	notifying you of the changes.
