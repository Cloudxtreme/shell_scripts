    <h3>Tarsnap Bug Bounties</h3>
    <div class="boxcontents">
      <p>
	According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus'_Law">Linus'
	Law</a>, "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  This is one
	of the reasons why the Tarsnap client source code is publicly
	available; but merely making the source code available doesn't
	accomplish anything if people don't bother to read it.
      </p>
      <p>
	For this reason, Tarsnap has a series of <i>bug bounties</i>.
	Similar to the bounties offered by
	<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html">Mozilla</a> and
	<a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/encouraging-more-chromium-security.html">Google</a>,
	the Tarsnap bug bounties provide an opportunity for people who find
	bugs to win cash.  Unlike those bounties, the Tarsnap bug bounties
	aren't limited to security bugs.  Depending on the type of bug and
	when it is reported, different bounties will be awarded:
      </p>
      <table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0><tr>
	<td>Bounty value</td>
	<td>Pre-release bounty value</td>
	<td>Type of bug</td>
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$1000</td>
	<td>$2000</td>
	<td>A bug which allows someone intercepting Tarsnap traffic to
	  decrypt Tarsnap users' data.</td>
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$500</td>
	<td>$1000</td>
	<td>A bug which allows the Tarsnap service to decrypt Tarsnap users'
	  data.</td>
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$500</td>
	<td>$1000</td>
	<td>A bug which causes data corruption or loss.</td>
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$100</td>
	<td>$200</td>
	<td>A bug which causes Tarsnap to crash (without corrupting data or
	  losing any data other than an archive currently being written).
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$50</td>
	<td>$100</td>
	<td>Any other non-harmless bugs in Tarsnap.</td>
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$20</td>
	<td>$40</td>
	<td>Build breakage on a platform where a previous Tarsnap release
	  worked.</td>
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$10</td>
	<td>$20</td>
	<td>"Harmless" bugs, e.g., cosmetic errors in Tarsnap output or
	  mistakes in source code comments.
      </tr><tr>
	<td>$1</td>
	<td>$2</td>
	<td>Cosmetic errors in the Tarsnap source code or website, e.g.,
	  typos in website text or source code comments.  Style errors in
	  Tarsnap code qualify here, but usually not style errors in upstream
	  code (e.g., libarchive).</td>
      </tr></table>
      <p>
	The pre-release bounty value will be awarded for bugs reported in the
	interval between when a new Tarsnap release is sent to the
	<a href="lists.html">tarsnap-alphatest@tarsnap.com</a> mailing
	list and when it is announced via the
	<a href="lists.html">tarsnap-announce@tarsnap.com</a> mailing list
	(this will usually be one week) which were introduced in the new
	release (i.e., for bugs which are corrected before they get into an
	announced release).
      </p>
      <p>
	In addition to the
	<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/download.html">Tarsnap source
	code</a>, bug bounties will be awarded for bugs found in
	<a href="scrypt.html">scrypt</a>, <a href="kivaloo.html">kivaloo</a>,
	and <a href="spiped.html">spiped</a>.  Please note that, with the
	exception of $1 cosmetic errors, these bounties do not apply to the
	Tarsnap website; in particular, <b>please do not run automated
	vulnerability scanners against the Tarsnap website</b> &mdash; they're
	annoying and don't produce useful bug reports.
      </p>
      <p>
	Think you've found a bug?  <a href="contact.html">Contact the
	author</a> (preferably using his
	<a href="tarsnap-cperciva-key.asc">GPG key</a>
	if you think your bug might have security implications).  <i>Please
	put the words "bug bounty" into the subject line of your email.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
	Past Tarsnap bug bounty recipients are listed
	<a href="bounty-winners.html">here</a>.  When reporting a bug, please
	mention if you would like to remain anonymous.
      </p>
      <h4>The fine print</h4>
      <ol><li>
	Bounties of under $100 will be awarded as Tarsnap account credits.
	Bounties of $100 or more will be awarded as Tarsnap account credits
	or via US dollar cheque depending upon the recipient's preference.
      </li><li>
	A bounty will only be awarded to the first person who reports a bug,
	unless two or more people report the same bug at approximately the
	same time, in which case the bounty might be split between them.
      </li><li>
	If the same bug appears in multiple files (e.g., when a function is
	declared in a .h file and when it is implemented in a .c file) it
	will normally only receive a single bounty.
      </li><li>
	Reports of security-related bugs are not eligible for bounties if the
	bugs are publicly disclosed prior to being fixed.
      </li><li>
	Only the discoverer of a bug is eligible for the associated bounty.
	(In particular, I'm not going to award bounties to people who just
	read libarchive commits and forward me bug fixes from there.)
      </li><li>
	Bounties will not be awarded if it is illegal to do so.  Residents of
	Iran, North Korea, Myanmar, Syria, etc... you know the drill.
      </li><li>
	The classification of bugs, values of bounties, and conditions under
	which bounties are paid are subject to change without notice.
      </li><li>
	Tarsnap Backup Inc. has sole discretion to determine whether a bug
	report qualifies for a bounty and for which bounty it qualifies.
