    <h1>Trademark Usage Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Updated May 14, 2011<p>
    <p>The FreeBSD Foundation(the "Foundation") is a
    501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the FreeBSD Project
    (the "Project").FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server,
    desktop, and embedded computer platforms. It is
    derived from BSD, the version of UNIX&reg; developed at the University of California,
    Berkeley and is developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.
    Additional platforms are in various stages of development.</p>

    <p>The FreeBSD Foundation gratefully accepts donations from individuals and businesses, using
    them to fund the Project, which engages in continued development of the FreeBSD operating
    system. In addition, the Foundation represents the FreeBSD Project in executing
    contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements which require a
    recognized legal entity, including granting licenses or permissions to use the
    FreeBSD trademarks and logos (collectively, the "Marks"). The Foundation is entirely supported by
    donations.</p>

   <p>The Foundation is responsible for maintaining the Marks, which are
   used, among other things, to identify source code, documentation, projects, and
   other material originating with or through the Project. By following our
   Trademark Usage Terms and Conditions, you help us protect the goodwill associated with the Marks,
   as well as the open source nature of the FreeBSD operating system.</p>

  <p>Please note that the following Terms and Conditions are intended to cover typical
   situations, in a general way, but that there may be special circumstances,
   which, in the judgment of the Foundation, result in different or additional
   requirements for your use of the Marks. Any individual, organization, or company may use the
   <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/logo.html"> Marks</a>
   to show support for the Project or as part of a notice to users
   that your product incorporates the FreeBSD operating system. On websites, the
   Marks should always link to http://www.freebsdfoundation.org or http://www.freebsd.org.
   You may not use the Marks in any way which is unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory,
   pornographic, or profane, or in any other way that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under the law or otherwise diminish
   the goodwill and integrity of the Marks. The Marks may not be used on product packaging or to promote products and services, or
   to create the impression of an endorsement or certification unless you comply with all of the following: </p>
   <p>1. Anyone who uses any of our Marks is required to comply
    with these use guidelines, as well as the requirements in your license, if you
    are a licensee. For special or unusual projects, we may ask you to comply with
    requirements specific to your use.</p>

   <p>2. You must request our permission to use the Marks at 
   trademark@FreeBSDFoundation.org prior to any use of the Marks, and we may grant or withhold permission to use the Marks
   in our sole discretion. </p>

   <p>3. If we grant you permission to use the Marks, your use of
   the Marks must always be fully and clearly reproduced, and you may not
   incorporate any of our Marks into the trademarks, service mark, logos, or name
   of your business, project, or organization, unless you have the express prior written
   permission of the Foundation.</p>

   <p>4. The first time that you use the word "FreeBSD" in any medium, you must conspicuously indicate
   that "the mark FreeBSD is a registered trademark of The FreeBSD Foundation and
   is used by ______ &lt;&lt;Insert the name of your organization&gt;&gt; with the
   permission of The FreeBSD Foundation." If you use any of the other Marks in any medium, you must also conspicuously indicate
   that such Marks are trademarks of The FreeBSD Foundation and are used by ______ &lt;&lt;Insert the name of your organization&gt;&gt;
   with the permission of The FreeBSD Foundation.</p>

   <p>5. You must use our Marks in their entirety. We must approve
   in writing in advance any variation in the form of our Marks. </p>


   <p>6. A trademark symbol &reg; or &trade;, as applicable, should follow
   all prominent uses of the Marks.</p>

   <p>7. Certain types of projects, products and packaging may
    require additional or different notices. Please contact us for more information
    and to discuss your intended use. </p>

   <p>8. We may, in our discretion, limit the quantities of products or other materials that bear our marks.</p>

   <p>9. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
    Foundation, its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives from
    and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs (including reasonable
    attorneys' fees) or other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of or
    from (i) your breach of these Terms and Conditions and (ii) your activities in
    connection with the use of our Marks.</p>

   <p>By accessing and using the Marks,
   you agree to abide by the terms and conditions set forth above. The Foundation hereby reserves the right at
   any time and without advance notice, to change, modify, add or remove any
   portion of these Terms and Conditions in whole or in part, at any time, and any
   such change will be effective when notice of such change is posted. Your
   continued use of the Marks after any changes to these Terms and Conditions are
   posted constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>

   <p>We realize
   these Terms and Conditions are being introduced at a point in time when some
   companies and individuals already have product names that include the Mark.
   Companies and individuals using the Marks as of May 1, 2006 will not be
   required to change their already existing product names to comply with these
   Terms and Conditions now or in the future. However, we do request that these
   companies and individuals give proper notice and attribution of our Marks and
   that any new product name will follow these Terms and Conditions.</p>
