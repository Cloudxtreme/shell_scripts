  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>There's a whole slew of reasons why we eat something. Convenience is a factor, for sure. Hunger, of course, is another. And then there's always the consideration of what's cheap. But now, researchers have shown that Twitter, of all things, can be a useful tool in helping us understand the relationship between eating behaviors and reasons for eating. </p>

<p>University of Arizona researchers asked 50 study participants, between ages 18 and 30, to tweet everything that they ate for three days, along with a hashtag to indicate the type of food they were eating and <em>why</em> they were eating it. (For instance: "Cheeseburger between classes at the Student Union #protein #convenience.")</p>

<p>By doing this, researchers were able to make a visual representation of all the foods the study participants were eating, in the context of <em>why</em> they were eating them. This "allowed us to really see that there are, in fact, relationships, and those relationships do seem to align with the ones in the literature, which shows that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://uanews.org/story/you-are-what-you-tweet-using-twitter-to-track-dietary-habits">convenience and cost</a> are among the main motivators" for consuming food, study researcher Melanie Hingle, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the university, said in a statement. </p>

<p>"It's good to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://uanews.org/story/you-are-what-you-tweet-using-twitter-to-track-dietary-habits">raise awareness about your habits</a> since a lot of eating behavior is unconscious or really habitual," Hingle added. "You tend to get in your groove and not get out of it, so this kind of shakes that up and makes you think about what's influencing you. It can help you develop new habits or just become aware of the ones that are not doing you any good."</p>

<p>The study is published in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jmir.org/2013/6/e125/">the Journal of Medical Internet Research</a>.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p></p>

<p>If you're tired of technology being used against you -- and how can you <em>not</em> be after the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/nsa-prism-costs-tech-companies-paid">the latest NSA spying allegations</a> -- then you'll probably appreciate this man-bites-dog story.</p>

<p>It comes to us by way of Bryan Lawver, who recently rented a car in Florence, Italy. When he returned the vehicle, an associate told him he was "one minute" past the grace period and would be charged an extra day.</p>

<p>"The agent refused to give us a return receipt, but rather penciled info on our original rental agreement," says Lawver, who works for the federal government in Livermore, Calif. "I found that peculiar, but I lacked the language skills to explain my complaint."</p>

<p>Fortunately, Lawver had a more high-tech answer. He used his Sony DSC HX10v, which has built-in GPS and resets its clock to local time, to take a timestamped photo of the car -- which, by the way, is <em>always</em> a good idea.</p>

<p>His photo of the agent and car showed that he'd returned the rental within the company's grace period. Lawver showed the image to a supervisor.</p>

<p>"That rectified the issue instantly," he says.</p>

<p><strong>Not a victim</strong></p>

<p>Some car rental customers seem to have targets on their back. They contact me when a big, bad rental company or subrogation company is asking them to pay a few hundred bucks for scratching the undercarriage of their rental, and each email to the company is filled with emotional language that would have you believe the rental companies stole their firstborn.</p>

<p>It's easy to buy into this culture of victimhood. After all, the rental companies invite it with their bullying tactics that include strongly-worded letters demanding immediate payments for often invisible, undocumented damages. Let's just say neither side is doing itself any favors.</p>

<p>But here's something Lawver -- and other renters -- are discovering: They're <em>not</em> victims, thanks to technology.</p>

<p>Consumers have received encouragement from an unlikely source: a man named Mark Duffy, who used to own National and Alamo franchises for the Island of Puerto Rico. I receive regular complaints about aggressive damage claims from these companies, and although its parent company, Enterprise, denies it, customers believe it operates its vaunted Damage Recovery Unit as a profit center.</p>

<p>Duffy created an app called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmwtec.picreport">Rental Pics,</a> which allows rental customers to easily photograph and organize pre- and post-rental images of their car. It even tells you <em>what</em> to photograph.</p>

<p>"I developed the camera system initially for our use," Duffy told me. But he recently sold his franchise back to Enterprise and spun the concept as a stand-alone app. Interestingly, he says Enterprise "continues to evaluate" the technology at San Juan airport. Hertz was testing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://elliott.org/blog/before-and-after-pictures-of-your-rental-car-now-thats-customer-crvis/">a similar program called CRVIS</a> a few years ago in Newark. Unfortunately, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://elliott.org/blog/what-will-your-next-rental-car-know-about-you-everything/">it was never adopted</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Leveling the field for us</strong></p>

<p>Technology can be the great equalizer when a car rental company wrongfully accuses you of something. Having reliable "before" and "after" images effectively eliminates any frivolous car rental damage claims. A GPS-enabled camera that can add a timestamp can counter a car rental agent's claim that you returned a car late.</p>

<p>It helps to understand the predicament car rental companies find themselves in. Profit margins are ridiculously thin, so dropping a $20 charge on a bill can mean the difference between making money and losing it. They're not gonna just let something go. They'll charge you for everything they can, because they feel they have to.</p>

<p>The only way to make sure they don't is to use the tech you have. Remember, without images and timestamps, a car rental company can potentially make any claim it wants to. The burden of proof is on <em>you</em> -- to say, "No, that ding was there before I rented the car," or "I brought the vehicle back on time."</p>

<p>In an ideal world, car rental companies would be taking photos of their own cars. They'd be GPS-tagged and time-stamped, too. Why don't they? Because that would cost them money, not just to set up and train their employees, but also in missed damage-claim opportunities.</p>

<p>So it's up to us.</p>

<p>Car rental customers don't have to be suckers. When a company demands we pay hundreds of dollars for every ding and dent, to shell out money for junk fees for "loss of use" and "diminution of value," and when they use time as a weapon to collect more money from us, we can fight back.</p>

<p>We can use technology to level the playing field. And we should.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>Strategy-based video games are good for your brain. </p>

<p>Research published in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070350">journal PLOS ONE</a> shows that gamers may benefit from their hobby because it seems to improve brain agility.</p>

<p>"Our paper shows that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/qmuo-pvg082113.php">cognitive flexibility</a>, a cornerstone of human intelligence, is not a static trait but can be trained and improved using fun learning tools like gaming," study researcher Dr. Brian Glass, of the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London, said in a release. </p>

<p>The study, conducted by Queen Mary and University College London researchers, is based on psychological tests conducted before and after 72 volunteers played the strategy game StarCraft or the life-simulation game The Sims for 40 hours over six to eight weeks. Most of the participants were female, as "the study was unable to recruit a sufficient number of male volunteers who played video games for less than two hours a week," the release stated. </p>

<p>Researchers found that the participants assigned to play StarCraft experienced gains in their performance on the psychological tests after the study period. They had greater speed and accuracy in cognitive flexibility tasks -- which were meant to assess the ability of a person to "switch" from one task to another -- than those who played The Sims. </p>

<p>Plus, researchers found that "the volunteers who played the most complex version of the video game performed the best in the post-game psychological tests," Glass said in the statement. "We need to understand now what exactly about these games is leading to these changes, and whether these cognitive boosts are permanent or if they dwindle over time. Once we have that understanding, it could become possible to develop clinical interventions for symptoms related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or traumatic brain injuries, for example."</p>

<p>Video games have been shown to provide brain benefits in other studies, too. Previously, a study in the journal Current Biology showed that action games could help <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/04/video-games-dyslexia_n_2805895.html">kids with dyslexia</a>. Researchers from the University of Padua found that playing an action game seemed to improve speed and accuracy of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/04/video-games-dyslexia_n_2805895.html">reading skills among children with dyslexia</a>, compared with playing a calmer game. And scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston found that high-school gamers <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/16/video-game-effects-teen-g_n_2147062.html">did better at virtual surgery</a> than even medical residents. </p>

<p>Of course, games like StarCraft have been fingered in the past for playing a potential role in promoting violent tendencies. Adam Lanza, the Newtown, Conn., shooter, supposedly was a StarCraft player, for instance. And according to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, more than half of people in the U.S. think there's some kind of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/video-games-gun-violence_n_3071632.html">link between gun violence and playing violent video games</a>. However, the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/16/violent-video-games-brain-effects-positive_n_2474438.html">research proving such</a> is still murky, HuffPost Science reported. And Paul Tassi, a contributor to Forbes magazine, explained why he believes <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/12/19/cnn-picks-their-game-to-blame-starcraft/">StarCraft in particular</a> isn't as violent as some may believe: </p>

Starcraft, for those who don’t know, is a top-down strategy game. Unlike titles like Halo or Call of Duty which have players aiming down the barrel of a gun, in strategy games you control entire massive armies at once from on high. There’s violence, as tends to happen in war, but you’re so far removed from the action, the blood onscreen is mere pixels. In Starcraft’s case, the game requires constant planning and fast-shifting strategic play. It’s not a twitch reflex shooter, or anything close to it.</span>  </div></li>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p><strong>Barring a flurry of activity at ICANN or changes to the name collision mitigation plan, the launch of new TLDs won&#8217;t be a 2013 event.</strong></p>
<p>ICANN released updated <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-2-23aug13-en">contracting statistics</a> for its new top level domain name program yesterday, and applicants will be sad to see that there are still just four signed registry agreements.</p>
<p>Although a lot of applicants are going through the process, it has been slow going. </p>
<p>For example, the applicant for the Arabic IDN that means &#8220;site&#8221; said it was invited to sign the registry agreement on July 25. Noting that it would take 20 hours to travel to ICANN&#8217;s office in Los Angeles, it <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://domainnamewire.com/2013/08/16/a-month-after-first-4-tld-contracts-signed-still-only-4-signed/comment-page-1/#comment-2195326">sent a customer support request</a> to ICANN asking if there were other signing options (e.g. electronic signing, accredited agents to sign on behalf of a registry). After three weeks, it says it hadn&#8217;t heard back.</p>
<p>Why the delays? There&#8217;s are lot in flux, some of which will affect the contract, so ICANN is probably trying to slow down the actual signings until the details are finalized.</p>
<p>The big issue is the name collision mitigation plan. This is why, barring any signings in the coming week, that no more than four TLDs could officially launch in 2013.</p>
<p>The name collision plan, as proposed by ICANN, would require a waiting period of <em>at least</em> 120 days after a registry contract is signed before any domains may be activated under the TLD.</p>
<p>If a contract isn&#8217;t signed by September 1, that means no names could be activated until 2014. </p>
<p>Registries could still go forward with their sunrise period and landrush reservations and auctions, so there might be some buzz around that. But don&#8217;t expect to be able to hand register many new TLDs at a domain name registrar until next year.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>In these competitive times and with the holiday's looming, your Website experience needs to give customers a "warm and fuzzy" feeling. That is, it should be available and fast, with no major hiccups. Website monitoring is essential in delivering just that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finding the Right Site Monitoring Solution</strong>
</p>
<p>
How do you find a monitoring tool? Just set the monitoring budget, find a vendor, call the sales department and buy yourself some monitoring, right? Whoa, not so fast.
</p>
<p>
Finding the <em>right</em> monitoring solution requires delving into your business's needs and requirements. With your business's brand and reputation at stake, choosing the wrong solution could be disastrous, with customers leaving for a competitor's site due to unacceptable page load times and other performance or usability issues, including site downtime.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ask the right questions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Before you choose a monitoring service, ask the right questions. How do you know which ones to ask? They are largely dependent on your organization's business needs, but here are a few questions to get you started in the right direction:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. What type of monitoring will fit the business?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The two common types of monitoring are <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_monitoring">synthetic monitoring</a> and the somewhat newer <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring">real user measurements</a>. By simulating Website traffic, synthetic monitoring shows what could happen on your site and helps you set a performance baseline. Real user measurements show the actual experiences of real Website users.
</p>
<p>
You may decide that you need both to meet your performance needs. For example, testing a checkout process is different from testing a RESTful API, but both could be crucial to ensuring a solid customer experience. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.gartner.com/jonah-kowall/2012/12/11/the-unbridled-use-of-synthetic-application-monitoring/">Gartner</a> suggests using a blended approach of synthetic monitoring and real user measurements. Be sure your monitoring provider can support both. Managing multiple monitoring solutions can be costly and cumbersome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. What is the level of effort required to get started?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The level of effort needed to get the process started depends on the solution. When looking to replace an existing monitoring solution, do not expect any scripts or data to transfer from one solution to another. If an in-house expert set up the old solution, that person may not be qualified to setup a new monitoring solution using a different technology &#8212; at least not without taking the time to learn the new offering, which would pull the person away from existing projects. Ask prospective vendors, therefore, if they offer professional services. An experienced consultant can implement the new solution quickly, delivering a flawless set-up or transition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Is the data provided by the solution acceptable and is the information easy to access and understand?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If the information the monitor captures is difficult to discern or access, the purpose of a monitoring solution is lost. Without easy access to data that is clear and actionable, identifying site performance issues becomes cumbersome, which in turn degrades the value of the monitoring solution. If previewing a new monitoring solution, delve into the results reported by the monitors. Identify important reporting features for the business, and make sure those features can be found easily and can quantify the results as expected. A robust monitoring solution will do much more than simply indicate if the site is up or down. Having valuable, real-time analytics and reporting allows you to identify and resolve issue before customers become aware of the problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Does the new solution have alerting options and what are they?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Advanced alerting features can provide greater flexibility when performance alerts are triggered. Advanced alerting is much more than sending out some email messages when your monitor reports a problem with the site. Truly advanced features can spin up additional instances in Amazon Web Services(AWS) if the site appears under load and more resources are needed. It can also send HTTP requests to another end point, change monitoring locations based on the time of day, and much more. You should consider whether having a solution with an advanced alerting platform is right for your business.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. Is the monitoring solution limited to the client side?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If internal performance needs to be monitored, look at solutions that offer internal monitoring options. Most involve hosting a private monitoring agent within the internal network. This can be useful for correlating internal and external data. Internal monitoring can also help identify potential issues or raise an alert about the internal network &#8212; before it becomes an external customer-facing issue resulting in downtime and damage to the brand.
</p>
<p>
While there are more questions to ask and items to consider prior to selecting a monitoring solution, these should help get your organization started. Try not to make any commitments before getting the answers you need. By identifying which monitoring features are critical to your goals, you shouldn't have much trouble finding the right solution &#8212; one protects your brand and customer experience.

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>Steve Ballmer's announcement today that he will retire as Microsoft's CEO after 14 years at the helm highlights the challenges high technology companies have in sustaining their success. Ballmer's tenure was marred because he permitted Microsoft's Office and Windows businesses to dominate the company. Meanwhile, opportunities in smartphones, search, mobile applications, social media, and on-line videos were ceded to emerging companies from Google to Blackberry, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (now part of Google). Led by the return of Bill Gates' old nemesis, Steve Jobs, Apple has far surpassed Microsoft in every category except PC software. Even there, Jobs was able to finesse Microsoft in creating the iPad that has contributed to the steady decline of the PC business. </p>

<p>To his credit, Ballmer invested heavily in R&amp;D -- over $10 billion in the past year -- but Microsoft has little to show for it. Like many of its high tech counterparts -- Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo, Nokia, Dell, Blackberry, Kodak and Motorola, to name a few -- Microsoft has been unable to overcome the dominance of its core business. Thus, it is following a similar path to IBM with mainframe computers in the 1980s. Most likely the crowning blow for Microsoft's founder-dominated board was the fiasco with Windows 8, its mainstream product update. </p>

<p>Microsoft's problem is not a technology problem but an organizational one. It is the classic issue addressed by my HBS colleague Clay Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma. The dominant business that generates most of the profits gets the bulk of the resources and attracts the best people in the company. Meanwhile, the dominant group squeezes resources for emerging businesses, especially when funds are tight, and focuses its R&amp;D on replacement products, not true innovation. Similar things happened in the pharmaceutical industry which, with the exception of Novartis and J&amp;J, missed the biotech, med tech, and generic revolutions. </p>

<p>We had a similar problem at Medtronic with the dominance of our cardiac rhythm business, made up of pacemakers and defibrillators, which used to account for 80 percent of revenues and 90 percent of profits. Seeing the eventual saturation of that market, we used its cash flow to spend heavily to build a series of medical technology businesses through internal ventures and acquisitions. These include neurological disease, spinal disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, along with emerging businesses in otolaryngology and urology. Today the latter businesses account for more than 60 percent of Medtronic's revenues and make up the bulk of its growth. </p>

<p>Ballmer contributed to Microsoft's innovation problem by personally dominating its organization, not letting anyone have sufficient authority to counteract the power of the mainstream business. The consequence is that after 14 years -- which is four years too long for a high-tech CEO to be at the helm -- Ballmer is leaving Microsoft with no successor in sight. Shame on the Microsoft board for letting this happen.</p>

<p>So the company is turning to Heidrick and Struggles to propose a successor. Let's hope the Microsoft board is wiser in the selection process than the Hewlett-Packard board, which four times unsuccessfully went outside its ranks for a new CEO, yet never found a leader who could restore the innovative, egalitarian culture of HP's glory days. IBM's approach should be a role model: it recruited Lou Gerstner, who had no computer background but was a superb strategist and leader, to get the company back on track. Gerstner wisely groomed Sam Palmisano as his successor, turning over the reins after only eight years. In the past decade Palmisano remade IBM into a highly successful enterprise systems and solutions company and groomed an internal successor, Ginny Rometty, to carry on the IBM success story.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Microsoft's board, there are excellent candidates who could rebuild its innovative spirit.  Three in particular come to mind: Jeff Bezos, CEO of Seattle-based Amazon; Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook; and John Donahoe, CEO of eBay. It is unlikely Bezos would make the shift, but Sandberg might welcome the opportunity to become CEO rather than COO. Donahoe is less well known, but has done a superb job in remaking eBay after taking over a declining franchise from former CEO Meg Whitman.  </p>

<p>At this writing Microsoft's future is very much in doubt. For the sake of America's dominant position in the global high tech field, let's hope its board goes the route of IBM and not HP. Doing so will require all the wisdom of Bill Gates and his fellow board members.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>Online communities often stay online, but when they bridge into the real world, reality expands, people change and movements begin. The MeetUp platform, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://meetupblog.meetup.com/post/21449652035/9-11-us">launched in response to 9/11 in New York</a>, has vaulted out of computer screens to connect real people meeting in the real world, whether they want to talk about adventure travel or poodles. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/">TED Talks</a> are live events with high ticket prices, but their free online component (videos) unite people offline and on in a celebration of ideas. </p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.plantvillage.com/">PlantVillage</a> creates connection between people who want information about the food they grow.  It's a free, open-access knowledge base about  edible plants.  On their website you can participate in a worldwide Q&amp;A and there's a growing library section. Now a just-launched <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id687782186">mobile app</a> is available in the iTunes Store. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Why would it matter to share knowledge about plants?  Because when you're talking crops, you're talking food.  By mid-century, we'll have <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130609195713.htm">an estimated</a> nine billion people to feed on the planet.  </p>

<p>"We do this because we feel that knowledge about growing food plants is a basic human right," says PlantVillage co-founder Marcel Salathé. He's a professor of biology at Penn State, and along with David Hughes, a Penn State assistant professor of entomology and biology, they created and maintain PlantVillage. After the site caught on worldwide -- there's a great need for food plant information -- the next step for Salathé and Hughes was naturally a mobile app. </p>

<p>"Because plants are in the field it makes sense to bring the computer there, through the enormously powerful phones we carry around. With the built-in cameras users can take images of plants and ask questions, right next to the plant," Hughes wrote me in an email. </p>

<p>Whether food is grown on a large, industrial farm or on a small plot, the bugs eating the crops and the diseases sweeping through, all demand solutions. Knowledge is power, and it's a relatively new thing for plant information to be open-sourced, as it is on the PlantVillage site and app. According to Hughes, formerly most food crop information was kept under wraps, the property of chemical and pesticide companies commissioning research studies, or else the information was closely held by Big Ag, and it often cost money to access. PlantVillage, in contrast, provides it for free. "We want to democratize the access to the world's knowledge on food plants," says Hughes. </p>

<p>As a worldwide online community, PlantVillage is thriving. Since launching this past February, the site has had more than 100,000 visitors from 191 countries. The knowledge base has expanded to include more than 150 crops, 1,100 disease entries and 450 pictures. You'll find nearly 1,500 questions and answers about food plants on the site.  </p>

<p>Wikipedia has been <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/wikipedia-celebrates-750-years-of-american-indepen,2007/">mocked</a> for providing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2131458/Up-articles-Wikipedia-contain-factual-errors.html">wrong answers and false information</a>. PlantVillage, also in the wiki mode, makes an effort to source its information by connecting plant growers with experts. They've got Land Grant and private university scientists, extension officers, master gardeners, scientists from USDA, backyard growers, community garden growers and seed companies all talking. </p>

<p>"The reaction we get from this very diverse community is very positive," says David Hughes. "For disease biology and crop health we are learning through our platform where gaps in understanding disease dynamics exist. This simply has not been collected before because of short term studies. So, going forward this will be very important." </p>

<p>Though growing plants for food has been going on for a very long time, it's only recent online technology that allows for a mobile, crowdsourced plant knowledge system. Hughes and Salathé see PlantVillage developing into a open-access, global plant disease surveillance platform, leveraging the powerful photo and GPS capabilities of smartphones.  With the ubiquity of smartphones (an <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/a#subscribers">estimated 6.8 billion mobile subscriptions</a> worldwide), this technology is one way we might meet the challenge of feeding nine billion people on the planet.  </p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>The man <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/deric-lostutter-raid-kyanonymous-steubenville_n_3403000.html">who claimed responsibility for the leaks</a> that drew national attention to the Steubenville rape case now says Amazon.com recently fired him because of his association with the loosely-affiliated network of “hacktivists” known as Anonymous.</p>

<p>Deric Lostutter, 26, told The Huffington Post that he began his job at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lanereport.com/23459/2013/08/amazon-opens-customer-service-center-in-winchester-with-550-permanent-employees/">a new Amazon call center in Winchester, Ky.,</a> earlier this month, but was fired after his supervisors discovered his home had been <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/deric-lostutter-raid-kyanonymous-steubenville_n_3403000.html">raided by the FBI in connection with the Steubenville case</a>.</p>

<p>“They pulled out a list of online articles and asked for my side of the story, then escorted me off the property stating that even though i havnt [sic] been charged, i could no longer work there because it made them feel uncomfortable that i have a political affiliation with anonymous,” Lostutter told HuffPost in a text message.</p>

<p>Lostutter said he was told not to come back to work after his first day on the job and officially fired several days later. </p>

<p>Amazon did not return several requests for comment. Lostutter sent HuffPost a picture of his Amazon insurance card as a verification of employment. </p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/labor/at-will-employment-overview.aspx">Employers in Kentucky can hire and fire people as they like</a>, as long as that reason isn't an illegal one (like racial or religious discrimination). Lostutter's legal options are limited, said Kurt Scharfenberger, a Louisville, Ky.-based attorney who specializes in labor law.</p>

<p>“If it’s alleged you’ve done some sort of misdeed, your employer may suspend or fire you,” Scharfenberger said. “It’s certainly not fair, but it is legal.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately the law is pretty narrow when it comes to termination,” he added. </p>

<p>Lostutter, who also goes by the screen name KYAnonymous, took credit in an interview with HuffPost for leaking "all the photos that the players had already posted then erased" in the Steubenville High School rape case, where two football players were ultimately <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/17/steubenville-rape-trial-verdict_n_2895541.html">found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl</a>. A photo of the players carrying the victim while she was passed out, along with a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://deadspin.com/5972527/she-is-so-raped-right-now-former-student-jokes-about-the-steubenville-accuser-the-night-of-the-alleged-rape">video that showed a former Steubenville baseball player</a> making jokes about raping a “dead” girl, helped draw widespread attention to the case and sparked outrage across the country. Lostutter said he had a hand in leaking the infamous video as well.</p>

<p>"The tweets, screenshots, Instagrams ... Pretty much everything you've seen in the media, that came through me," <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/deric-lostutter-raid-kyanonymous-steubenville_n_3403000.html">Lostutter told HuffPost in June</a>. However, he noted, any images that went public were sent to him, and not the product of hacking.</p>

<p>FBI agents -- guns drawn -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/deric-lostutter-raid-kyanonymous-steubenville_n_3403000.html">raided Lostutter’s home in April</a>. Agents took his laptop, flash drives, an external hard drive and two mobile phones, among other things.</p>

<p>According to Gawker’s Adrian Chen, the FBI targeted Lostutter <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/weaponize-the-media-an-anonymous-rappers-war-on-ste-512747826">in connection with the December 2012 hack of RollRedRoll.com,</a> the fan site of the Steubenville High School football team, and the email account of its webmaster, James Parks. After the site was hacked, a video of Lostutter -- wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and threatening to disclose personal information of Steubenville football players if they didn’t apologize to the victim -- appeared on the website.</p>

<p>Although Lostutter <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/weaponize-the-media-an-anonymous-rappers-war-on-ste-512747826">gloated about the website hack during an interview with Chen</a> -- but later asked Chen not to include that comment in his story -- he maintains he didn’t hack the site or email account. According to a report in The Herald Star, a man in Virginia Beach, Va., identified as BatCat, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/582917/Man-who-took-control-of-fan-website-talks.html?nav=5010">claimed responsibility for the hack</a>.</p>

<p>Tor Ekeland, Lostutter’s lawyer who's representing him in the FBI investigation, told HuffPost that although there is a U.S. attorney assigned to his case in connection with the Steubenville fan site hacking, there is no indictment against Lostutter.</p>

<p>As for his firing from Amazon, Lostutter's next steps are unclear. He told HuffPost he started a new job on Friday, describing it only as an "IT consultant."</p>

<p>But it's not difficult to see why a company like Amazon, which handles sensitive customer information like credit card numbers and addresses and has a robust cloud computing business, might be hesitant to employ someone whose home was raided by the FBI in connection with hacking.</p>

<p>Lostutter said that he passed a drug test and background check before he was hired by Amazon, but it appears that the company didn't do a simple Google search before it brought him on. The FBI raid was covered extensively online.</p>

<p>"It’s not like I want anything from Amazon," Lostutter told HuffPost. "But I want to make it known that discrimination won’t be tolerated. We have rights just like anybody else has," he said, referring to members of Anonymous. "We’re not Al Qaeda. We’re not trying to destroy America and the American people. We’re the 99 percent.”</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>Geoff Huston's <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/20130820_a_question_of_dns_protocols/">recent post about the rise of DNS amplification attacks</a> offers excellent perspective on the issue. Major incidents like the Spamhaus attack Geoff mentions at the beginning of his post make headlines, but even small attacks create noticeable floods of traffic. These attacks are easy to launch and effective even with relatively modest resources and we see evidence they're occurring regularly. Although DNS servers are not usually the target of these attacks the increase in traffic and larger response sizes typically stress DNS infrastructure and require attention from operation teams.
</p>
<p>
Amplification attacks can be launched in a couple of different ways, but we've mostly seen attacks using DNS resolvers, deployed by providers as part of their service (some attacks rely on sending queries directly to authoritative servers). The attacks we're seeing are especially insidious because of the way they work. As Geoff points out researchers have detected tens of millions of "open resolvers" on the Internet; the overwhelming majority of them are home gateways with open DNS proxieswhich attackers can easily induct into their exploits. Not only do attackers get access to a substantial pool of devices but bouncing their attack queries off home gateways also conveniently circumvents protections network operators may have in place such as source address validation (to prevent address spoofing from within their network) and restricting access to resolvers they deploy ("closing" the resolver to off-network queries). What this means is even providers doing the "right" things can still be complicit in amplification attacks &#8212; through no fault of their own.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this year we've seen DNS resolvers at large ISPs around the world report much higher than normal volumes of DNS queries. In some cases network infrastructure such as load balancers has been stressed to failure from traffic spikes, causing shifts in load to other DNS servers. Fortunately in the cases we've seen DNS servers have been properly dimensioned and highly resilient, remaining available even with substantially increased load. Visible events like this are obvious indications of attacks and always cause operations to investigate.
</p>
<p>
Detecting amplification attacks requires proper tools to identify unusual traffic and determine root causes. Most DNS servers can capture query data but some server releases are substantially taxed when logging is turned on so the extra CPU cycles need to be factored in to infrastructure sizing to ensure performance metrics will be achieved and subscribers have the best possible experience (low latency responses). In this case operations had ready access to DNS query data, which was captured as a standard practice since it had minimal impact on their servers.
</p>
<p>
Access to data is always necessary but rarely sufficient in troubleshooting a problem; exposing vital details to identify an attack requires navigating through large data sets and visualizing query data. In these cases the Ops teams had access to additional tools which allowed them to easily show Top Domains queried. This revealed names they hadn't seen among the Top Domains before. Further navigation and visualization allowed them to drill down into the data to determine the types of queries being made. Query counts associated with each query type were also available so it was easy to gauge magnitude.
</p>
<p>
Operations staff immediately recognized a spike in ANY queries, which are widely known to be evidence of an attack. ANY queries have virtually no legitimate uses; they're used for amplification attacks because they return all the DNS records for a domain, turning very small questions into extremely large responses. Depending on the name queried with ANY amplification can be as much as 80 times. With readily available data and tools telltale signs of an amplification attack were revealed: atypical domain names were among the Top Domains and ANY queries were being used for those domains. With these insights in hand the Ops team was able to take steps to mitigate the attack. This will be discussed in the next post.
</p>
<p>
Because relatively familiar techniques were used in these attacks identifying them was much easier. As attackers change their tactics, using less well known names that aren't easily associated with attacks for instance, or distributing their attacks widely, identifying attacks will get harder. But no matter what ready access to DNS data and analytical tools will be essential. Subsequent posts will discuss additional methods for detecting attacks as they evolve.

  <div class="views-field views-field-description">        <span class="field-content"><p>What was once regarded as "curb appeal" -- the first impression a home buyer forms of a house as he pulls up to the curb -- has moved to our computer screens. More than 90 percent of home buyers use the Internet to look at houses and more than 40 percent of those who buy houses first see them online, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.realtor.org/">said the National Association of Realtors</a>. </p>

<p>While many real estate agents understand that this shift in how we look for homes underscores the need for high-quality online photos, there are still a few who apparently didn't get the memo. In fact, spotting some of the most cringe-worthy photos has become a sort of sport. There are several websites -- including a few run by real estate agents -- that track them. Our favorites are <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hookedonhouses.net/bad-mls-photos/">HookedOnHouses.net</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://BadMLSPhotos.com">BadMLSPhotos.com</a> and agent <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lianejamason.com/category/bad-mls-photos/">Liane Jamason's</a> site. </p>

<p>It seems that the most-awful photos are found at the lower end of the market where perhaps marketing budgets are the slimmest and listing agents with no photography training resort to using their cell phone cameras. (Agents representing high-end properties tend to hire professional photographers.) </p>

<p>How serious a problem is it? <a rel="nofollow">Barry Bevis, a Florida agent</a> who runs the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://BadMLSphotos.com">BadMLSphotos.com</a> website, says, "Bad photos can cost you showings and may result in a lower sale price."</p>

<p>While the sins of listing photography are many -- starting with just plain out-of-focus pictures -- Bevis, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2011/07/08/bad-mls-photos-and-the-lessons-they-teach/">and others</a>, offered these tips for home sellers and their agents:</p>

<p><strong>1) Declutter before you snap the shutter. </strong><br />
 Kids toys should be put away, desks should be straightened, and all drawers and cabinets should be closed. Not to state the obvious, but the dishes in the kitchen sink must be washed and put away before the photo is taken. As for overflowing laundry baskets, well, we can only ask "Really?"<br />
</p>

<p><strong>2) Sellers shouldn't appear in the photo.</strong><br />
The idea is to show off your house, not you sitting on the couch watching TV, or in this case standing in the doorway trying to stay out of the photo. The real hazard of a picture of Uncle Bob holding a beer at your backyard BBQ is that prospective buyers won't be able to envision their own families enjoying the outdoor entertainment center.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>3) Agent-photographer shouldn't be in the photo either.</strong><br />
This frequently happens when an agent-photographer tries to shoot photos of the bathroom or dining room and is caught in the mirror reflection. What's wrong with it? It just looks silly and unprofessional and distracts from the purpose at hand: Show the house and its features.<br />
 </p>

<p><br />
<strong>4) House "mug shots" shouldn't include cars.</strong><br />
The mug shot is the house picture taken from the street. The home and its landscaping should fill the frame. You shouldn't see the car parked out in front. Same for electrical wires, Christmas lights in June, overgrown weeds, or trash cans. In this case, the car could have been moved and the photo shot to exclude the mailbox.<br />

/&gt;<br />
<strong>5) Pets.</strong><br />
You may love Fido -- and yes, nothing says "high-end class" the way the Irish Setter posing next to the Bentley in the circular driveway does -- but if you don't have a Bentley or a circular driveway, it's probably better to remove your dog from the couch. Ditto for picking up pet food dishes. Buyers may be allergic or just not share your appreciation for kitty's designer litter box in the tub. As for the kitty here, she appears to be heading off for a swim in the pool.<br />
</p>

<p>And while Rover here certainly looks like a nice enough fellow, do you get the idea that the photographer was afraid to venture closer?<br />
</p>

<p><strong>6) Turn off the TV.</strong><br />
You want people looking at your house, not trying to figure out what was on the TV. And yes, that's what they do. Fireplaces are OK to leave on.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>7) If it's dark, light it up.</strong><br />
There is no rule that says you can't turn lights on. Professional photographers frequently add lighting.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>8) Don't let your personal tastes get in the way of a sale.</strong><br />
And who thinks Tweety Bird needs to fly off into the sunset? Part of an agent's job is to be blunt about what might hinder the sale of your home -- or at least not feature it in a photo.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>9) Don't focus on a piece of furniture, no matter how nice it is.</strong><br />
If you aren't selling that exercise bike, why feature it in a photo? This isn't Craigslist.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>10) Don't get lazy.</strong><br />
This is a nice pool, but what viewers will see are the nice gate and lock. Couldn't the agent have opened the gate? We found too many photos shot from the agent's car with the car's side mirror in the shot.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>11) And perhaps most important of all: Eliminate the weird stuff.</strong><br />
Elvis might have stopped by last Christmas, but maybe keep it to yourself?<br />
</p>

<p>And is that really a banana peel on the chandelier?<br />
