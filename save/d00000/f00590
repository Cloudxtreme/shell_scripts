<h1>Public Speaking</h1>
<p> 
<I>John Levine</I> speaks to industry, government, and professional groups
on a wide range of topics.
<P>
Dr. Levine has been on the Internet and its predecessors for 20 years,
and in the computer software business for over 25 years.
As he moved from the software business
into writing <A HREF="books.phtml">books</A> and <a href=consult.phtml>consulting</a>, speaking has been a natural extension of those businesses.
<P>
The goals of both writing and speaking are fundamentally the same: to teach,
to communicate the excitement and possibilities of the topic, and to break
through the morass of details and confusion that so often get in the way
of understanding computers and the Internet.
</p>
<H2>Topics</H2>
<P>
For each speaking engagement, Dr. Levine creates a talk that meets the needs
of the talk's sponsor. In many cases, the sponsor wants one of the standard
presentations,
while in some cases they've spent several weeks defining the topics and working
out the details of the talk.
<P>
Some frequent topics include:
<ul>
  <LI><p><B>Spyware, Phishing, Spam and Cybersecurity: What Can We Do?</B>:
    We're all seen reports about the online security crisis.
    This talk outlines the problem and steps that organizations and
    individuals can take to formulate and implement their response.</p></li>
  <LI>
    <p><B>Making E-mail Work for You</B>: We all depend on e-mail, but spam and
viruses can make e-mail pretty unpleasant.  Is there a way out?
	A more specialized
   version of the presentation focusing on the spam crisis is also available.</p></li>
  <LI><p><B>What Identity Mean on the Internet?</B> A 1993 <i>New Yorker</i>
  cartoon said ``On the Internet, nobody know's you're a dog.'' Then it was
  funny, now it's a problem as we try to use the Internet for commerce and
  other functions where identity is critical. We look at the evolving meaning
  of online identity, and trends in managing identity and reputation.</p></li>

  <LI><p><B>The Culture of the Internet</B>: After twenty-five years, the Internet
    has developed a distinct culture of its own with traditions and expectations.
    Ignore them at your peril if you plan a net presence.</p></li>
