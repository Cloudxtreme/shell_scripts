<p>The current Internet network layer protocol - Internet Protocol 
    version 4 (IPv4) - has been strained by the rapid growth of the Internet.
    Many regions of the world are beginning to transition from IPv4 
    to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) to support the global need 
    for a larger number of publicly accessible Internet addresses.  
    The transition has been underway since 1997, 
    with the IPv6 Internet coexisting with the IPv4 Internet.</p>


<div>

<p>Since 2000, CAIDA has generated AS Core graphs -- Internet Topology Maps also referred to as AS-level Internet Graphs -- in order to visualize the shifting topology of the Internet over time, as can be seen in the <a href="../historical.xml">historical view</a>.</p>

<h3> Data </h3>
<p>
    

    This visualization represents a macroscopic snapshot of the
    IPv6 Internet topology collected during the first week of January
    2008.  Topology data was collected with <a href="http://www.wand.net.nz/scamper/">scamper</a> by volunteers
    responding to a request sent to the North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG) mailing list.  There
    were 56 contributors in 53 different cities, in 9 countries, and 3
    continents.  The snapshot reflects measurements from 
    a total of 97 different IPv6
    source addresses from 68 unique IPv6 prefixes and Autonomous Systems (ASes).  The
    resulting IPv6 level graph contains 4,752 IPv6 addresses and
    526 IPv6 prefixes.

</p>
<p>

    We aggregated this view of the network into a topology of ASes.
    Each AS approximately corresponds to an Internet Service Provider
    (ISP). We map each IPv6 address to the AS responsible for routing
    traffic to it, i.e., to the origin (end-of-path) AS for the IPv6 
    prefix representing the best match of this address in Border Gateway
    Protocol (BGP) routing tables. We use the largest publicly
    available set of core BGP IPv6 routing tables, collected by
     <a href="http://www.ripe.net/projects/ris/rawdata.html">RIPE NCC</a>.
    The resulting abstracted AS graph consists of 486 AS nodes and
    1,904 AS-links (peering sessions).

</p>
<p>
    We mapped these ASes to geographic locations by taking the IPv4
    BGP table from <a href="http://www.routeviews.org">Routeviews</a> and mapping each AS to its set of announced IPv4 prefixes.  
	(IPv4 tables are currently much larger, facilitating more
	accurate inference of geographic coverage of an AS.)
	We subdivided prefixes into the smallest prefixes that 
    <a href="http://www.digitalenvoy.net/">Digital Envoy's Netacuity ®</a> mapped to a single
    geographic location in January 2008. We plot 
   the AS angle coordinate at the weighted 
	average (by number of IP addresses in each mapped prefix) 
    	of the longitude coordinates of these prefixes.

The position of each AS node is plotted in polar

calculated using the equations in Figure 2.


<p>

The outdegree of an AS node is the number of next-hop ASes that
were observed accepting our probe traffic from this AS.  The link color
reflects outdegree, from lowest (blue) to highest (yellow).  
Toward the center of the graph we have manually labeled some 
of the higher degree ASes with their associated ISP.

<b> <font size="-2"> Figure 3. A comparison of two different
	methods of observing IPv6 AS topology: 
	(1) probing forward IP paths with scamper, converting traversed
	IP addresses to ASes using longest BGP prefix match; and
	(2) inferring AS topology from BGP routing tables 
	derived from BGP announcements of connectivity, and trusting 
	that the announced connectivity actually transports traffic.
	</font>
	</b>
    
</div>
    


<p>
    In addition to prefixes, 
    RIPE NCC's BGP tables also contain AS paths for each prefix.
    We can use these AS paths to construct a 'BGP view' of the 
    IPv6 AS level graph, shown on the left in Figure 3. 
    Although the BGP view was larger than 
    the scamper (traceroute-based) view in terms of ASes and 
    IPv6 prefixes, it was smaller in terms of AS links.
    Table 1 compares coverage statistics for the two views,
	active probing vs. inference from routing announcements.
    The number of IPv6 sources in the scamper column
reflects the number of IPv6 addresses stored as sources of the
submitted traces, which may include duplicate private addresses.
The number of IPv6 sources in the RIPE BGP table reflects the number
of routers peering with the RIPE NCC BGP monitor. The number of
source ASes reflects the number of ASes listed as the first AS in
the BGP AS path.

<p>
The number of IPv6 prefixes in the scamper column counts the 
prefixes that contained at least one observed IPv6 address 
during the scamper path (active) probing.
The number of IPv6 prefixes in the RIPE NCC BGP column is the 
number of prefixes actively announced as viewed from 
this routing table.  
Of the original 1,013 IPv6 prefixes in the RIPE NCC BGP snapshot,
80% (822) had at least one destination in our probe list. 
	
Of these prefixes, only 
526 of these 1,013 prefixes were observed in scamper-observed paths, 
and only 467 prefixes were reached by a scamper probe targeting 
a destination in the prefix (the remaining 39 prefixes were 
seen in the traces, but not seen when they were the destination 
of the trace).
</p>
<p>
To calculate the number of ASes observed by scamper, we map each 
observed IPv6
address to the source AS for its longest matching IPv6 prefix found
in the RIPE NCC BGP table.  The number of ASes in the RIPE NCC BGP 
data includes those that do not originate any prefix announcements 
in the table, but act as transit. 
We compiled AS links by mapping adjacent IPv6
addresses to their corresponding ASes.  Interestingly, although
scamper observed only 58% of the ASes seen in the BGP table, we inferred
12% more AS links from the scamper-observed IPv6 addresses 
than the BGP table implies.
</p>
<p>


</p><div style="float:right; width:400px;">
    
<img src="../pics/ccdf-as-outdegree-2008.png">
    <b><font size="-2"> Figure 4. The complementary cumulative distribution 
	function (CCDF) plot of outdegree distribution of ASes the 
	scamper-derived and BGP-derived AS graphs shows that the 
	scamper/traceroute tool heavily samples ASes with outdegree 
	less than 50 while the RIPE BGP tables imply substantially higher 
	degree connectivity. </font></b>

</div>



<p>
We emphasize that
these two representations of topology data come from fundamentally
different ways of sampling Internet connectivity: (1) passive
observation of what publicly available BGP tables report about 
peering relationships, 
or (2) inferences from active transmission of  traffic across a
hopefully representative set of paths. 
Figure 4 plots the complementary cumulative distribution function 
(CCDF) of the outdegree for ASes in both data sets, and shows the
difference in coverage achieved by the two sampling methods.
Specifically, scamper/traceroute more heavily samples links 
connecting from ASes with moderate outdegree, between 5 and 50, 
while BGP data implies more links connecting high degree ASes.
We explore this disparity further with the joint degree 
distribution of the ASes on either side of a given AS link.
</p>
<p> 


Figures 5 and 6 show a joint degree distribution for ASes on
sending and receiving sides of an inferred AS link.
The color of each data point represents the
density of AS links with degrees (x,y) on the sending
and receiving ASes.  The direction of a link corresponds to
which direction a scamper probe observed the link, or 
which direction the BGP table implied traffic would flow.
For example, observed path <b>A B C</b> yields directed 
links <b>A-&gt;B</b> and <b>B-&gt;C</b>.  The x-axis of Figures 5
and 6 plots outdegree for <b><i>sending</i></b> ASes and
the y-axis plots outdegree for the <b><i>receiving</i></b> ASes.
Most links observed in the BGP data (Figure 6) connect ASes of 
all sizes to receiving ASes with outdegree less than 20.  In
contrast, Figure 5 shows that active scamper probe data 
observes many links from smaller outdegree ASes to larger
outdegree ASes.  The symmetric square patterns in Figure 5 
reflect scamper observation of more bi-directional connectivity 
between ASes of moderate outdegree, between 5 and 50. 

 </p>
<p>

The difference in the graphs is consistent with the fact that
scamper measurements originate from many more sources than there
were peers in the BGP data sample. This enables acquisition of more topology 
data from outside the core, i.e., from ASes with smaller AS outdegrees.  
Many of the links captured by scamper/traceroute are peering links, 
which often do not get announced beyond a single neighbor AS. Our 
BGP table view is unlikely to capture these links.

<h3>Reachability of IPv6 Address Prefixes Delegated by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) </h3>
<p>


In addition to graphing the AS-level topology and examining the
link structure and distributions, we also measured how many of the 
RIR-delegated IPv6 address prefixes we could reach with a probe.  
(Unlike IPv4, in IPv6 thus far each delegation consists of a single
prefix.) We created a
destination list with a single IPv6 address (the .1 address) from
each delegated IPv6 prefix seen in the RIR delegation reports from
January 1, 2008. 
</p>
<p>


Our plots distinguish between <i>reached</i> and <i>seen</i>
since scamper saw several prefixes in the middle of a path 
(in 'transit') that we could not reach when we probed that
prefix directly, as destinations.
A possible explanation for this incongruity is that the
packets were dropped at the border router when the traffic was
directed at the prefix itself, but not when the prefix was used as
transit.

<p>

    While all RIRs have made IPv6 delegations, Figure 7 
    shows that RIPE has most aggressively delegated IPv6 prefixes, at
    roughly twice the rates of APNIC and ARIN.  Although RIPE NCC
    has a larger number of prefixes routed, Figure 8 shows that
    APNIC has a larger percentage of its delegated prefixes routed.

</div>

<p>

Figure 9 shows how the network prefix delegations breakdown by
RIR and by prefix length.  Though each RIR sets its own assignment
policy, the two most common delegation sizes so far have been /32 and
/48, with only RIPE NCC and APNIC assigning a significant number of
prefixes in the /33 to /35 range.

</p>
<p>

    Figure 10 divides each delegated prefix into /48
    sized chunks so we can compare the relative amount of
    address space covered by each RIR's delegations. When examined
    this way, the delegation gap between APNIC and RIPE shrinks, but 
	the gap between these two RIRs and all the others is larger. 
	Since a large
    percentage of RIPE NCC's routed prefixes come from its larger
    delegations (/32s), Figure 11 shows that RIPE's percentage of routed
    addresses is larger than its percentage of routed prefixes shown
    above in Figure 8.  LACNIC also shows an increase, but both
    ARIN and APNIC show relative drops in their percentage of routed
    addresses verses routed prefixes, reflecting the smaller 
    size of delegations in the ARIN and APNIC regions.

<h3> Caveats </h3>
<p>
     We emphasize the following limitations
    of CAIDA's scamper-based IPv6 AS core graph.
    </p><ul>
<li> Some organizations administer
    multiple ASes, although usually there is a one-to-one mapping
    between an AS and a network organization.  </li>
<li> The IPv6 Internet Topology Map AS-level graph 
	reflects observations and conditions during the
	measurement window: January 2-8, 2008.  </li>
<li> The graph represents forward IP
    topology information, with IP addresses mapped to origin ASes
    using a BGP routing table. The graph does not reflect all
    information about peering sessions or constitute a complete
    route map. Our BGP table view is unlikely
    to capture peering links which do not get announced beyond a
    single neighbor AS and therefore incomplete.
    </li>
<li>
    The graph reflects observations of the IP layer only, and does 
	not capture information regarding
	lower layers, e.g., ATM, physical fiber, information.
    </li>
<li>
    The graph does not address any performance or
    workload measurements, precluding comparison of
    ISPs in these dimensions.
    </li>
<li>
    Nodes with many links may be located on the outer rim if their AS has 
	an observed outdegree of zero.
    </li>
</ul>
