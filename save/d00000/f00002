				<h3>KAME Project Manifest for Completion<br />
R&amp;D for IPv6:The new stage focused on Operations and Applications</h3>
				<p style="text-align:right">
WIDE Project<br />
Representative: Jun Murai
				</p>
				<p>
The KAME Project (Representative: Prof. Jun Murai, Keio  University) launched in 1998 concentrating on the research and  development of IPv6 technologies, has succeeded in the global  standardization of the basic specifications and in establishing the  framework required for commercial marketing of IPv6 technologies.  Having achieved its initial objectives, the WIDE Project has called a  stop to the activities of the KAME Project and will now focus on  strategic research and development activities to further enhance IPv6  technologies and development applications for new areas.
</p>
				<p>
					The KAME Project, a joint industry and academia  research initiative launched in April 1998, has formed the essence of  the WIDE Project’s research and development activities into IPv6  technologies. The KAME Project was established with the aim of  incorporating BSD UNIX reference software (<a href="20051107-KAME-e.html#n1">Note 1</a>)  into the next generation Internet, assuming a similar role as that of  the CSRG (Computer Systems Research Group) of the University of  California, Berkeley in incorporating and leading to its wide adoption  in the global Internet. The KAME Project conducted research and  development of IPv6 protocol stacks (<a href="20051107-KAME-e.html#n2">Note 2</a>)  on BSD UNIX and has actively participated in the activities of the IETF  (Internet Engineering Task Force), an organization concerned with the  global standardization of Internet technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reference software developed by the KAME Project  for IPv6 protocol stacks for BSD UNIX has been released as open  software and as a result has come to be widely used by academic  communities both inside and outside of Japan and industrial circles.  Numerous R&amp;D organizations and corporations are also using it as a  shared software base, making possible the research and development of  network and computing equipment. This has resulted in; (1) increased  efficiency in R&amp;D activities as it is no longer necessary to  research and develop identical protocol stacks separately, (2) enhanced  interconnectivity and, (3) as the source codes have been released, has  contributed to the efficient nurturing of software engineers for which  it has gained global accolades.
				</p>
				<p>
					At present, with the completion of global standardization of the basic IPv6 specifications by the IETF, (<a href="20051107-KAME-e.html#n3">Note 3</a>)  implementation projects are underway including one by the government of  the United States to incorporate IPv6 into the government network by  June 2008 and the CNGI (China Nest Generation Internet) project in  China, IPV6 technologies have entered into the phases of practical use  on an international level. The KAME Project, in recognition of the  significant contribution it has made in increasing the efficiency of  research and development of IPv6-based computer equipment networks and  its wide spread deployment was awarded with a group award from the  Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications in 2002.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having achieved its objectives, the WIDE Project has  concluded the activities of the KAME Project and is now concentrating  on the strategic repositioning of the project members to focus on  strategic research and development activities to further enhance IPv6  technologies and development applications for new areas. A particular  focus is to be placed on practical and integrated research and  development into network architecture, operating systems and middle  ware and applications for areas including mobile ad hoc networking,  sensor networking and architecture for end user security to contribute  towards the development of further enhanced and advanced IPv6  technologies.

						<a name="n1" id="n1"></a>(Note 1) BSD UNIX and Reference Software<br />
						BSD UNIX is a multi-user, multi-task or in other words “UNIX” computer  operating system (OS) developed by the CSRG (Computer Systems Research  Group) of the University of California, Berkeley. It incorporates  TCP/IP protocol stacks*, data transmission protocol that is widely used  on the Internet today. This software is widely released as open  software and was widely shared and used as an industry standard (de  facto standard) in the construction of and research and development  activities into computer networks (the Internet) that ran off UNIX.  This de facto standard software is known as “Reference Software”.

I  had the privilege of leading this project during my time at Stanford  University and at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. I  have always recognized and appreciated the KAME project, led by Jun  Murai, that has contributed strongly to the deployment and improvement  of the Internet. IP version 6 is the next generation core networking  protocol, that has been standardized by IETF. All of us recognize that  the IP version 6 specification has long been stable and is now ready  for business deployment. Jun Murai and his KAME project have made great  contributions to the development, establishment and deployment of IP  version 6 technology. I am looking forward very much to further  technical and social contributions to the Internet community, beyond IP  version 6, by the KAME project, by Jun Murai and by the WIDE project.</em>

											<em>In the early 1990s, Frank Solensky and others  realized that the initial design of IPv4 addressing was resulting in a  fast and inefficient deployment of the IPv4 address space, and that  with the commercialization of the Internet that resource would be soon  exhausted. A number of efforts were started simultaneously to address  that issue; these included, in the very near term, recovery of some of  the allocated-but-unused address space, development of private address  space and address translation, and a project to create a next  generation Internet Protocol. The outcome of that last was IPv6.</em>
										</p>
									<p>
										<em>We knew, of course, that IPv6 deployment would  take a long time – we talked about the protocol development and  deployment taking a decade. What we didn't take into account was the  rapid fossilization of the Internet into IPv4 - with each step that we  took deeper into commercial service, it became harder to convince  people to deploy something simply because it was a step forward. We had  to come to a real problem and demonstrably have a real solution to it,  not just have something that would avoid future problems and maximize  our ability to deploy new applications.</em>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>There is a story told about an automobile  mechanic having a conversation with a heart surgeon. He comments that  &quot;you and I seem to have similar jobs: I can observe the problems that  the engine is having, replace or repair various parts, and close it  back up again.<br />
											Tell me, doctor: why is it that I get paid what I am paid, and they pay  you what they pay you?&quot; The Doctor replies: &quot;trying fixing it while the  engine is running.&quot; What we had to learn was how to repair the Internet  &quot;with the engine running&quot;, which is a challenging proposition.</em>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>Doing that, of course, required extensive proof  of concept, new applications that demonstrated the value of IPv6-based  applications, a reference implementation that undeniably worked well,  and also vision and leadership. The KAME Project provided much of that,  both in the products and research experiments and in the personal  leadership of Dr.Jun Murai. It served as the basis for some commercial  products, and for others demonstrated what could be done if  applications were unshackled from a wired-network client/server  architecture. I am not certain that we could have deployed IPv6 in  today's Internet without the leadership and the technology developed in  KAME.</em>
