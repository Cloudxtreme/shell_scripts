                <td><p>Welcome! If you are a new participant in the IETF, this page is meant for you. It gives a short introduction,

                    some general advice to new participants, and a guide to sources of further information. If you are simply curious

                    about where RFCs come from, look <a href='#whither'>here.</a></p>

                  <p> The IETF's mission is &quot;to make the Internet work better,&quot; but it is the Internet <em>Engineering</em> Task

                    Force, so this means: make the Internet work better from an engineering point of view. We try to avoid policy

                    and business questions, as much as possible. If you're interested in these general aspects, consider joining

                    the <a href="http://www.isoc.org">Internet Society</a>. Most participants in the IETF are engineers with knowledge                    

                    of networking protocols and software. Many of them know a lot about networking hardware too.</p></td>

            <h3><a name="structure" id="structure"></a>Structure</h3>

            <p>The IETF's standards development work is organized into 8 Areas (<a href="/iesg/area.html">http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html</a>).  Each Area has 1 or more Area Directors (ADs), which together comprise the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  The IESG is responsible for technical management of IETF activities, the Internet standards process, and for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the Internet &quot;standards track,&quot; including final approval of specifications as Internet Standards and publication as an RFC.</p>

            <p>Within each Area there are multiple Working Groups (WG).  Each WG has one or more chairs who manage the work, and a written charter defining what the work is and when it is due.  There are more than 100 WGs.  The WGs produce Internet Drafts (I-Ds) which often lead to the publication of an Internet standard as an RFC. See <a href="/wg/">http://www.ietf.org/wg/</a> for WG charters and <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/</a> for the list of the Areas, the current WGs and their chairs.</p>

            <p>People interested in particular technical issues join the mailing list of a WG (<a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/list/wg/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/list/wg/</a>) and occasionally attend one or more of the three IETF meetings held every year.  See: <a href="/meeting/">http://www.ietf.org/meeting/</a> for meeting details.</p>

            <h3><a name="participation" id="participation"></a>Participation</h3>

            <p> The IETF is completely open to newcomers. There is no formal membership, no membership fee, and nothing to

              sign. By participating, you do automatically accept the IETF's rules, including the rules about intellectual

              property (patents, copyrights and trademarks). If you work for a company and the IETF will be part of your

              job, you must obviously clear this with your manager. However, the IETF will always view you as an individual,

              and never as a company representative.</p>
            <h3><a name="MentoringProgram" id="participation"></a>Mentoring Program</h3>
            <p>The IETF Mentoring Program matches experienced IETF participants with newcomers (people who have participated in three or fewer face-to-face meetings or anyone registering as a student) in order to aid their integration into the IETF community through advice, help, and collected wisdom. The guidance provided by the mentors should speed up the time it takes for newcomers to become active, contributing members of the IETF. For more information, including information on how to request a mentor, see here: http://www.ietf.org/resources/mentoring-program.html.</p>
            <h3><a name='start' id="start">How to Start</a></h3>

            <p>Some good news for your travel budget: it's possible to participate in the IETF without ever attending a meeting.

              If you really want to get results, you probably need to attend some meetings, but it's certainly not required

              to get started. The IETF carries out most of its detailed technical work online, with the primary method being

              email. Every WG has a dedicated mailing list, and that's where proposals are made and discussed, where issues

              are raised, and where consensus is established. (Since the IETF has no formal membership, decisions cannot be taken by voting; the method is to establish rough consensus on the mailing list.) </p>

            <p><u>Working Group Mail Lists</u></p>

            <p> A good technique for newcomers is to decide on one or two (not more!) WGs whose topics are interesting or

              relevant, and join their mailing lists. Beware: if the WG is in an active phase of discussion, you may well

              receive tens of message a day from each list. You need to be using a mail program with a good method of automatically

              sorting incoming mail into multiple inboxes. Once you have that working, simply read the mail threads daily,

              and read any draft documents that they refer to. (See the next section for hints on how to find particular

              drafts.) It's advisable to wait several weeks before starting to contribute to the mailing list. But when you feel comfortable that you have something new to say, go for it!</p>

            <p> The IETF is normally very welcoming to newcomers, and tolerance is the rule. The technical level is quite

              high, so if you write something that turns out to be wrong, you may get some quite frank replies. Or sometimes

              you will get a reply from someone whose first language is not English, and they can be rude without intending

              it. (If someone is seriously offensive, the WG Chairs are supposed to deal with it.) Don't be discouraged;

              everybody started as a newcomer.</p>

            <p><u>Attending a Meeting</u></p>

            <p> After participating by email for a while, it may be time to attend your first meeting. Details are linked

              off the IETF home page as soon as available. This isn't free; apart from travel and hotel costs, there is

              a meeting fee. Be sure to arrive in time for the Newcomers Tutorial, always held early on the Sunday afternoon

              before the meeting starts. It will give you a lot more information than this brief introduction. Also on Sunday

              afternoons, typically between 1600-1700 local time, is the Newcomer's Meet &amp; Greet, which is a hosted reception

              where first-time attendees and WG Chairs mingle informally for an hour. Try to stay at the meeting for the
