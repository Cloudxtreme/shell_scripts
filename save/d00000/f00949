<p>The IETF meeting in Berlin is now over. I hope everyone has been able to return home safely, and that you all can enjoy at least a weekend if not some vacation time after a busy meeting week. I will be on vacation myself for a couple of weeks. This was the first time that I had the responsibility for the full meeting week as an IETF Chair. Unsurprisingly, I got to do less technical work than in previous meetings, but it was very rewarding to see so much activity that others are doing.</p>
<p>But I wanted to highlight a few items from last week that I felt were important. First off, I think we had a very successful meeting. In the end there were 1426 participants on site from 62 countries. More attendees than we have had in long time and more countries than we have ever had. There were 12 new working group proposals, and while many of them were scheduled to this meeting in a very early stage, surprisingly many of them seemed to have successful discussions at the meeting. My guess is that two thirds of these will soon be up to be approved as working groups.</p>
<p>In addition to new work, the meeting also attracted a record 316 first-timers. An influx of new people is important, to make sure that we understand the challenges in all aspects of Internet technology. This meeting was also the first for our new mentoring system. Volunteers from the IETF attendees had set up 50 mentors helping new people find their way in the IETF, for instance to establish contacts with other people. For me, an important part of the meeting is the ability to interact with other people building devices in the Internet. Specifications aside, these interactions are a crucial part of setting up new, interoperable technology to the Internet.</p>
<p>We also had a great social event, thanks to <a href="http://www.denic.de/en/homepage.html">DENIC</a>, our platinum sponsor for the meeting. I have yet to find an engineer who does not love trains, and everyone seemed to be having fun. Thank you, DENIC! I would also like to thank our other sponsors for the meeting and the Bits-n-Bites event: <a href="http://www.telekom.com/home">Deutsche Telekom</a>, <a href="http://www.eurid.eu/">EURid</a>, <a href="http://dyn.com/">Dyn</a>, <a href="http://eco.de/">ECO</a>, and <a href="http://www.advaoptical.com/">ADVA Optical Networking</a>, <a href="http://www.a10networks.com/">A10 Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a>, <a href="http://nominum.com/">Nominum</a>, <a href="http://www.ipso-alliance.org/">IPSO Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a>, and <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/">Internet Society</a>. Thank you!</p>
<p>The practical meeting organisation seemed to work well, people liked the hotel and the facilities. Many have suggested that we should return to Berlin and Germany soon. There were only two issues during the meeting that I am aware of. First, one of the routers that we use for running the IETF network had been damaged in transit. <a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/">Juniper</a>, who has provided these routers, stepped up and was able to deliver two replacement routers on a moment&#8217;s notice. Thank you! Secondly, Berlin had exceptionally warm weather during our meeting, and air-conditioning struggled to keep up &#8211; it was hot inside, too. I personally experienced difficulties on Sunday with the IESG and IAB all in a small room, but for the rest of the week it felt cooler.</p>
<p>The IETF is not just about specifications and paper, it is also about running code. I was glad to see so many instances of running code in this meeting and around it. An interop event on 6LowPAN technology, XMPP hackfest, NAT64 live testing on the IETF network, using the Opus audio codec for remote attendees, home networking demos, distributed mobility demo, Code Sprint to work on IETF tools, the Bits-n-Bites demos, and probably many other things that I&#8217;m not aware of. Bits-n-Bites was so well attended that it was at times difficult to get to the demo tables. I would like to see even more code in our next meeting. If you have a test or demo in mind &#8211; lets talk.</p>
<p>6LowPAN testing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6lowpan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-351" alt="6lowpan" src="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6lowpan-1024x678.jpg" width="625" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>Code Sprint:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/codesprint.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-352" alt="codesprint" src="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/codesprint-1024x678.jpg" width="625" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>From my personal perspective, some of the most interesting work in the meeting related to Internet of Things (many of the new work proposals were in this space), home networking (also some new proposals and a lot of running code), and multimedia communications from browsers (WebRTC). I also liked the new Advanced Queue Management (AQM) work proposal, an effort attempting to make sure that bad router buffering practices do not waste capacity. This group has a real chance of improving how responsive the Internet feels to individual users, even without increasing their broadband connection speed.</p>
<p>During the meeting, we continued the discussion of many technical and organisatorial issues. In our administrative plenary, Kathleen Moriarty and Suresh Krishnan gave an update on what the diversity design team has been working on. While the work on this front has just started, I felt that the discussions are on a concrete and productive path. I&#8217;m looking forward to the improvements we will make in this space.</p>
<p>As usual, there are many discussions in the IETF outside the open meetings. Engineers talking to each other, implementors sharing experiences, operators explaining their needs, and so on. I was also happy to see that in this meeting we had many people from outside our traditional participant base &#8211; root server operators, network operators from developing countries, regulators and policy makers, ICANN specialists, and students. From what I can observe, they engaged in many useful discussions. For instance, the IAB met with some of these participants.</p>
<p>Finally, we also did a video version of this summary during the IETF week. It is available on YouTube at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_pmGTZYldU">IETF Channel</a>. The media was also interested in our meeting. Here&#8217;s a link to a half an hour program broadcast on German radio about our meeting: <a href="http://ondemand-mp3.dradio.de/file/dradio/2013/08/03/dlf_20130803_1630_4618def8.mp3">program</a>.</p>

			<p>I wanted to return to a topic that we have talked about before: increasing diversity at the IETF. The word &#8216;diversity&#8217; is a catch phrase, but I&#8217;m talking about bringing different kinds of people into the IETF who have not traditionally been here. Making IETF inclusive for all participants. I am very proud to report that at this Berlin meeting, we have attendees from a record 73 different countries. It is rare to have an organisation that draws people from so many places. This is something to be proud of.</p>
<p>But this is <em>not</em> enough. We need to go further. And I want to talk about the motivation in more depth. <em>Why</em> do we need to strive for a more inclusive IETF? And what are we doing about it? With this in mind, I worked with Pete Resnick to talk about our goals:</p>
<p>First off, we have room to improve. Geographic diversity is just one tiny aspect of the overall goal. What about vendors <em>and</em> operators? More <em>academics</em>? <em>Gender</em> diversity? Reaching to the <em>areas</em> of the world where there is still relatively little participation? Helping different participants to become <em>editors and leaders</em>? Coping with different <em>discussion cultures</em>? We recently talked to someone who classified the IETF as a &#8220;harsh&#8221; environment. IETF discussions go very quickly to critique and criticism of proposals, often in unnecessarily dismissing manner. Food for thought for all of us to improve our communication?</p>
<p>Secondly, diverse teams work better. They have more experiences to draw on. They have several problem solving and communication styles. Thirdly, the world competes for talent. The IETF needs to welcome everyone.</p>
<p>So, what are we doing? We can not claim we have made much of an impact yet, but we have started a number of efforts that will hopefully lead to great improvements in the long run. The Internet Society is helping us by increasing their outreach and fellows programs. Our Administrative Committee is planning an upcoming meeting in South America. Our leadership wants to get involved in a number of other forums and local events. We created a design team to understand the diversity problem and suggest solutions to make the IETF more inclusive. Volunteers created a mentor program that helps newcomers get introduced to the IETF. And there is a record 265 newcomers in this meeting.</p>
<p>This is all great, but it is good to keep in mind that we have only started our journey. There is a lot of work ahead. And we are probably missing many things that we should be doing. Please send us feedback!</p>
<p>Jari Arkko, IETF Chair and Pete Resnick, Applications Area Director</p>
<p>P.S. We wanted to thank Kathleen, Suresh, Mary, Adrian, Brian, Alissa, Barbara, and others for interesting discussions in this space.</p>

			<p>A while ago I wrote about the issue of the IETF document process being quite <a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/2013/05/balancing-the-process/">heavy-weight</a> in its final stages. Documents go through a lot of review and changes in their last few months. Some of this is natural as the document gains more exposure.</p>
<p>But often difficult tradeoffs get re-discussed at this stage, late surprises are discovered, and significant document changes occur. And since the documents are within the responsibility the IETF steering group (IESG) during the final stages, this leads to a situation where much of this process is managed by the steering group. But letting the working groups drive their technology and be responsible for changes would be better. A distributed organisation scales better, and the working groups are also equipped to involve the individual participants.</p>
<p>We are now experimenting with three changes to improve this situation. These changes are small, but we are hoping that they will have a positive effect.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform some reviews that are now happening at IETF Last Call a bit earlier. This will put the working group in a bigger role in resolving cross-area and general issues.</li>
<li>In the IETF, each document that passes through the approval process has a <em>document shepherd</em>. They are usually the working group chairs. We have started to invite document shepherds on IESG voice calls when there&#8217;s a document that is likely to require discussion. This will make it possible for the document shepherd to be involved in all the discussions.</li>
<li>When a document has a number of issues, hand over the process back to the working group, as opposed to the IESG tracking the issues. Among other things, this will ensure that changes are discussed in an open working group list and agreed through consensus.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these changes do not by themselves decrease the amount of work done in the final stages, we believe that if successful, this experiment will enable working groups to deal with issues before IETF Last Call and IESG review and empower the working groups to be in charge of the documents throughout their life cycle. We are also hoping that document quality will improve and number of issues discussed in the IESG will be lower.</p>
<p>Discussions are ongoing with the IETF working group chairs and review teams about the practical details of this experiment. Review team members may be asked to review a document when the work has finished in the working group but before an IETF Last Call is started. Working group chairs may ask for these reviews, and if they do, they will be managing the discussion with the reviewer and the working group carefully.</p>
<p>The IETF review teams &#8211; such as the Security Directorate (SecDIR), Applications Area Directorate (APPSDIR), or the General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) &#8211; have gained a significant role in ensuring that the IETF produces high-quality, understandable and implementable RFCs. In order to avoid overloading these teams, the teams may only take on some early reviews. The experiment will be evaluated after six months to determine whether the practice has been useful.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blog23_phone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-289" alt="blog23_phone" src="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blog23_phone-1024x680.jpg" width="625" height="415" /></a></p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m visiting the <a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a> meeting in Durban, South Africa. It has been an opportunity to meet many interesting people and get a glimpse of the issues that other important organisations in the Internet ecosystem deal with. And we need to work together on many topics. For instance, the new WHOIS service is worked on both by the ICANN and the IETF. Also, as the Internet has become so important for everyone, even we &#8211; the engineers from IETF &#8211; are realising that we need to reach out to more people who are impacted by Internet technology. The engineers responsible for different types of networks, domain name policy specialists, regulators, and so on.</p>
<p>But my visit to Africa prompted me to talk about something else as well: the incredible variation in Internet service. During the previous IETF meeting I had the opportunity to talk to a number of Internet policy experts, and I was struck by what they told me about peering. There is a lot of variation in peering practices around the world. In western countries we are used to highly capable Internet exchange points. But this is not the reality in all parts of the world. For instance, some South American countries struggle with limited local peering, forcing much of the traffic to transit elsewhere. This leads to slower Internet service and higher cost. And ultimately makes it more difficult to create local services.</p>
<p>But networking in Africa is even more interesting. In Durban, the network worked better than if I had been at home. But as I moved to the countryside where I am now writing this article, I get a network with a 20% packet loss and RTT that varies between one and six seconds.</p>
<p>At the ICANN meeting I had an opportunity to talk to a person from Chad about their networking situation. The numbers are interesting: Only <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm">0.4</a>% of population are on Facebook and <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm">1.9</a>% are Internet users. Only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Chad">2%</a> of homes are connected to the electricity grid. But yet, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orkii.com%2Fchad%2Fmobile-phone-penetration&amp;ei=USHnUbmQFcfChAetmoDACQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXrPdNVVNur6aE1btEyRFo04U-yQ&amp;sig2=lvu0vnjFpCSfliyV8-uusw&amp;bvm=bv.49405654,d.ZG4">31</a>% have a mobile phone. The implications are: first off, the developing world can jump over technology generations, such as moving directly to wireless. Secondly, the power situation creates new markets, people buy small generators, solar cells, and services to charge their phones. Thirdly, it is clear that Africa is the place with a lot of room for growth.</p>
<p>What can we do to support networking in these conditions? How can we create more access infrastructure for the Internet in developing countries? And, perhaps more importantly, how can we ensure that the Internet is open enough for all the local innovation, business, and content that will be created?</p>

<p>The <em>Internet of Things</em> is about embedding communications technology in all objects that can benefit from it, from cars to buildings, everyday objects and even materials. This is an ongoing revolution in the scope and scale of networking.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago the IESG approved Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-18">specification</a>, the base specification for a lightweight variant of HTTP, coming from the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/core">CORE</a> working group. This seems like a good opportunity to talk about a collection of techniques that I call the <em>Web of Things</em>. The Web of Things is about the use of the web technology for building communication capabilities for smart objects. I believe this is an important, easily available framework for this purpose.</p>
<p>Along with advances in making smaller microelectronics devices and low-power radio communications, the Web of Things is likely to have a big impact in the Internet of Things revolution. Yet, the Web of Things has progressed largely under the radar, because it is largely existing technology that is finding new uses. But I believe it is important we talk about it and realize its full potential. And that potential is big, similar to widely discussed technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN).</p>
<p>The core idea in the Web of Things is to represent the real-world objects as resources and interact with them using Representational State Transfer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">ReST</a>) style of communications. In other words, using all the normal tools that we already have for building the various web applications. These tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">IP itself, running on top of any link technology</span></li>
<li>HTTP and TCP, or CoAP and UDP</li>
<li>Data formats such as XML and JSON</li>
<li>TLS and DTLS for security, along with the necessary data object security mechanisms</li>
<li>Directory and discovery mechanisms such as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690">Core Link Format</a> or <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-00">Resource Directory</a></li>
<li>Application-specific resource definitions, such as the <a href="http://www.ipso-alliance.org/wp-content/media/draft-ipso-app-framework-04.pdf">IPSO template</a> or <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigBeeSmartEnergy/SmartEnergyProfile2.aspx">Smart Energy Profile 2.0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Given these tools, smart objects around us can communicate in an easy manner. In particular, there are tools and large number of people with experience on this technology. The communications protocols are known to work well in all networks. For instance, firewalls are likely to pass web traffic through for other reasons. And the web stack is surprisingly well suited for small devices. The picture at the top of this article shows a high-tech weight scale that I bought couple of years ago. This device uses Wireless LANs and the web protocol stack to communicate with the measurements database. With CoAP and perhaps some header compression at the link layer, these communications can be even more optimised.</p>
<p>More generally, when I look at technology deployment I see a pattern. Technologies that are easily available, free, work well in 90% of the cases, and that can be easily extended are usually the ones that end up being deployed quickly. Technologies that require multiple parties to agree or technologies that are highly optimised but targeted for narrow applications tend to lose. In this case the ability to deploy devices in any network, connect them to servers on the other side of the Internet is compelling for many developers.</p>
<p>The ability for everyone to easily package these new services as part of bigger application systems is also compelling. We often focus far too much on the devices and the communication link to them. For most applications this is just one small part of the overall system. There are other important components, such as databases, user interface servers, smartphone applications, and integration to other systems &#8211; such as social network applications. Typically, all these other components are based on web services.</p>
<p>As a result, building Internet of Things applications on the web services stack is easy, requires no permission from anyone, and is likely to be the cornerstone of most applications. The devices around you are probably using the Web of Things already, and there will be even more of them in the future. This is also a topic that several standards organisations around the world are looking at. In addition to the IETF, W3C has a <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/wot/wiki/Main_Page">group</a> to look at what new is needed to support this, OMA is doing work on lightweight <a href="http://openmobilealliance.org/about-oma/work-program/m2m-enablers/">device management</a>, IPSO and ZigBee have worked on profiles, and so on.</p>
<p>What is it then that remains to be done? I think we at the IETF should focus on building the framework and leave the specific applications, resource definitions, and link layers to others who are in a better position to understand their particular requirements. And as noted, much of the framework is already in place. But I believe there are areas where further work is needed. The world has just begun to map out what standards are needed in order for the resources and data formats to be compatible for specific applications. IPSO and ZigBee work on the application templates is a good start, but more is needed. At the IETF, we only recently started the standardisation of discovery and directory services for these kinds of applications. The resource directory work in CORE WG is an important component of this, but there may be other similar components that provide &#8220;middleware&#8221; services in the form of ReST interfaces. This work needs to continue.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Web of Things is a very powerful technology that makes it possible for developers to innovate and develop freely, minimizing the need to wait for other new components in networks, install new infrastructure, or redesign the way we build our applications. This technology is worth speaking about and worth putting into your devices.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/permissionless-innovation-tight.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-207" alt="permissionless-innovation-tight" src="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/permissionless-innovation-tight.jpg" width="477" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>I would like to talk about standards and what kind of approaches are suitable for developing them when it comes to Internet technology and applications.</p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>An engineering organisation such as the IETF with many implementors and operators is obviously very interested in ensuring that its technology actually works well, can be easily built into devices, and behaves well in the presence of other use of the network. Another obvious core value of the IETF is ensuring interoperability across implementations and the globe.</p>
<p>But there is a third goal that may not be equally obvious, yet it is very important, particularly for the role of the Internet in creating economic growth and supporting all communications needs. I call this goal the strive for <em>permissionless innovation</em>, the ability of others to create new things on top of the communications constructs that we create. Most new applications in the Internet are the results of grass-roots innovation, start-ups, and research labs. No permit had to be applied, no new network had to be built, and no commercial negotiation with other parties was needed when Facebook started, for instance. The easier we make the creation of these innovations, free of coordination and permission-asking, the faster the new Facebooks, Amazons, and Youtubes appear.</p>
<p>The architecture of the Internet, shaped by the end-to-end principle, supports this at a very basic level. The web technology is an example of an additional framework that enabled tremendous innovation, not just for human consumption but also as an underlying tool to create applications. Similarly, many other creations helped shape the Internet to what it is today. In the short term horizon I can see how WebRTC and the use of web technology for the Internet of Things are about to create similar revolutions in the future. Enabling every browser to make a call, every web server to be a voice provider, and every object to communicate seamlessly with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is not just about technology. The same openness that allows exciting new gadgets also allows individuals to use the Internet for their own purposes, communities to develop their own content, and generally enable people to connect better to each other.</p>
<h1>Open Standards</h1>
<p>But how do we create standards that fulfil such goals? Last year, the IETF, IEEE, W3C, ISOC, and IAB formalised some of the principles that we all believe in the <a href="http://open-stand.org">Open Stand</a> paradigm.</p>
<p>There are five <a href="http://open-stand.org/principles/">principles</a>. The first one is co-operation, for instance respecting the roles of different organisations. The second one is adherence to fundamental principles, such as achieving broad consensus and transparency. The third and one that is very important in my mind is collective empowerment, for instance choosing standards on technical merit and global interoperability, with the intent on enabling global competition. The fourth one is availability, making sure that standards can be accessed and implementations built on a fair basis. Finally, the fifth principle is voluntary adoption of standards.</p>
<p>Only this kind of an open process can produce tools that permissionless innovation requires. At the same time the innovation process itself results the need for some additional standards when the market develops to a point where multiple participants need similar capabilities. This is visible, for instance, in the current standards efforts around WebRTC where standard Javascript APIs are being developed to support applications from different voice service providers. When I look at other types of standardisation processes (for instance, those based on countries voting) it is hard to see how they can operate in such a fast-pace, multi-interest environment. Open standards are really the only possibility for ensuring that the Internet technology continues to develop at its maximum pace.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>These goals and principles have worked very well in helping create the technology that is behind today&#8217;s Internet. But they are even more important going forward. For instance, broad participation is going to be even more important in the increasingly connected world, where Internet matters for everyone from farmers to engineers to nurses to government officials. Secondly, decisions can not be taken without understanding the benefits and operation of a global communications networks.</p>
<p>It is very important that the Internet stays open, retains its global reach, and continues to develop at a fast pace in an open where all stakeholders have an ability to provide their input. Please help support this development in the face of increasing pressures facing the Internet and its governance in the coming years.</p>

<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is talking to various IETF contributors or people who rely on our results, and trying to understand their experiences about the IETF process and what kinds of technical topics they expect us to tackle. This article focuses on the process aspects.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback that I consistently hear is that too much of the IETF process is centered on the later stages and in particular the IESG review.  Documents rarely sail through the IETF last call and IESG review unchanged. At least 90% of the documents get revised. Many of these fixes are editorial, but some have technical substance. It is surprising that documents that were expected to be ready as they left the working group need so much revision.</p>
<p>Having been involved in the process for many years, often the bigger changes at this stage relate to cross-area issues, or the fact that the careful reviews from the IETF last call, directorates, and 15 ADs often represents a significant increase in the number of non-WG people looking at the document.</p>
<p>While some of this is natural as the document gains more exposure, it is still painful. Often difficult tradeoffs get re-discussed at this stage, late surprises are discovered, and significant document changes occur. These drawbacks are amplified by our informal processes through which changes are introduced. While we try to keep the working groups in the loop, sometimes the discussion happens directly between authors and reviewers or ADs. The WGs are not always directly informed, and it is rare to conduct formal last calls.</p>
<p>All this results in uncertainty for the progress of documents through the IETF, increases the work load of the IESG, and makes the working groups not be as central to the standards process as they should be. And yet, based on my experience a vast majority of those changes were necessary before the RFCs got published.</p>
<p>But is there a way to improve our process on this aspect? We are discussing some of these issues in an IESG retreat that is coming up next week in Dublin, Ireland. Input on these topics would be valuable. Are these problems real? What suggested methods could be used to reduce their effects? Why are we not doing more cross-area reviewing (by ADs or otherwise) earlier in the process? Please send feedback directly to <a href="mailto:jari.arkko@piuha.net">me</a> or discuss at the mailing <a href="mailto:ietf@ietf.org">list</a>.</p>
<p>Jari Arkko, Chair of the IETF</p>
<p><em>P.S. In case you were wondering where the graph came from &#8211; it is from my IETF statistics <a href="http://www.arkko.com/tools/stats.html">page</a>, but unfortunately the IESG measurement parts have not been working well in the last couple of years. I&#8217;m working on fixing them, but for this article I had to include an older statistic. Intuitively, current situation is similar to that in 2010.</em></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Diversity has been a recent big discussion topic at the IETF. Many of us have participated in this discussion, but I also wanted to bring it up here in the blog. Hoping for bigger involvement from different areas of the world or more equal participation from both genders is not new. The IETF is affected by typical IT field demographics, industry trends, and geographic growth areas. But we are starting to realise that improvements are necessary. The IETF can benefit of untapped potential and bring even more energy to the work. We can broaden our perspective, making sure that we understand the requirements for Internet technology from everybody, and then share it with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We think of diversity as something that covers international participation, different cultures, gender, age, organisational background, and so on. While I am very proud of the IETF as a very international organisation &#8211; with participants from 60 countries working on documents, for instance &#8212; there are many aspects of diversity where we could do much better. Overall participation is concentrated in some areas of the world, with little participation from Africa and South America, for instance. Similarly, while the IETF has some very active female participants and leadership members, the numbers are very small. Much of the work in the IETF is driven by large networking companies, yet academia and small companies would have more to give, and operational experience from additional operators would be similarly appreciated. Importantly, these disparities appear most prominently in our leadership, where institutional and structural issues can lead to even less diversity along all of the above mentioned axes than in our general population. All organisations benefit from a healthy influx of new participants at all levels, and in the IETF we need that to balance our well-established topics and participants, to build the next generation technologies, experts, and leaders.</p>
<p>In April we created a design team to look at the topic, and make some suggestions for improvements. The announcement is <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg78379.html">here</a>; Kathleen Moriarty and Suresh Krishnan are heading the team. Please contact <a href="mailto:suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com,kathleen.moriarty@emc.com">them</a> if you are interested in helping. I have given them an open assignment, with a desire to get advice on what steps we could take to increase participation in various aspects of the IETF, hoping for some initial advice before the next IETF. The design team will present their recommendations to the community, and engage in the discussion. Recommendations with community support will be taken forward.</p>
<p>The diversity team is a design team tasked with understanding the issues we are facing, drawing in experience from other organizations affected by similar issues, identifying obstacles to us having the widest breadth of talented participants and leaders, and making practical recommendations that could help us improve the situation. It is understood that many improvements may only take effect long-term, such as drawing in more participants from areas of the world where the IETF has traditionally not had much participation. Nevertheless, a set of actionable steps would be useful.</p>
<p>In addition to the design team, we are also working actively on other improvements. For instance, there is an independent effort in looking at improvements in mentoring.</p>
<p>You may think that while all the above are laudable goals but doing something in practice is difficult. I agree that this will not be easy. No one should expect a revolution. I do not have an idea about what to do about some of the issues. But still, I think we know some of the things we can do, and incremental progress is important. Speaking of incremental progress, I&#8217;m pleased that participation from South America seems to be on the rise:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-159" alt="sa" src="http://www.ietf.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sa-1024x530.jpg" width="625" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Is there something we could do to bring participation even more up from this? Could we extend the excellent ISOC fellowship program? Are there volunteer IETF people who could speak at select events in the area? Could we look at a meeting in that region, some years into the future? None of these actions make sense alone, but perhaps taken together we might have an end result where South America&#8217;s participation gets to a state where it perhaps should be, given the importance of networking for them as well as to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>We may also need goals to reach for. I personally would like to see a yearly increase in the diversity of our leadership at the WG level or higher. And in the next two years, I&#8217;d like to make decision about a future meeting outside our traditional North American, European, and Asian areas within the next two years. With growing local participation levels that justify choosing such a location. Doable? I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>In the coming months I hope that we have results from the design team, have better mentoring programs, have worked with ISOC on goals for various outreach programs, and have a better understanding of what it would take to meet outside our traditional regions. But I am not trying to pretend that we have all answers right now. What do <strong>you</strong> think we should do?</p>
<p>In summary, the issue of diversity and how we address it in the IETF is important for two reasons. First, more diverse participation will provide greater energy and insight to the central IETF activity of producing relevant, technically-excellent standards that help make the global Internet work better and continue to grow. Second, it is important to consider this matter in consistency with the principles of open processes and community input, that are key to the IETF.</p>
<p>Jari Arkko, Chair of the IETF</p>
<p>P.S. Thank you Alissa Cooper, Greg Wood, Kathleen Moriarty, Pete Resnick, Barry Leiba and many others for feedback on some of  the aspects discussed in this post. Credits for the participation graphic go to Bob Hinden.</p>

<p>I wanted to return to the topic of Bits-n-Bytes which we briefly reported on already <a href="http://www.ietf.org/blog/2013/03/running-code-at-ietf-86-2/">earlier</a>. Dan York and Paul Brigner from ISOC shot a few videos of some of the interesting demos, and the videos are now available below. In the videos you&#8217;ll find Dave Täht (TekLibre), Chris Griffiths (Comcast), Mark Townsley (Cisco), and John Jason Brzozowski (Comcast) speaking about their favourite technologies. I worked with John to give you a recap of what was exhibited. John has also generously offered to organise and execute Bits-n-Bytes since IETF 85 in Atlanta. We are quite pleased with how this event has turned out for the IETF, the participants, and our sponsors. Increased attendance and participation for each event was a clear indicator of the success and popularity of Bits-n-Bytes.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="352" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/d-vwdD3Xtyg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Bits-n-Bytes first took place during IETF 84 and has since been organized during each IETF as an integral part of the agenda. In addition to showcasing technology from our sponsors, the goal of Bits-n-Bytes has been to provide insight into how IETF contributions are being used and deployed on a daily basis around the globe. Running code is very important to the IETF, as discussed in our previous article. The demonstrations and testing that we do in Bits-n-Bytes not only helps provide feedback to improve work but also helps to stimulate future work that is essential to the growth and continued success of the Internet. Given the charter of the IETF and the nature of the work that takes place during a typical IETF, Bits-n-Bytes is an excellent venue to display and demonstrate the same.</p>
<p>The latest installment of during IETF 86 in Orlando, Florida hosted by NBC Universal and Comcast Bits-n-Bytes included many interesting demonstrations, following is a recap of what was exhibited.</p>
<p>First, Comcast through support from some key manufacturers Arris, Broadcom, and Cisco made available a functioning DOCSIS 3.0 broadband network, which was fully IPv6 capable, that provided the foundation for many of the other demonstrations that were unveiled during the event. The DOCSIS network and services that were demonstrated are analogous to what many Comcast customers use in their homes today. Arris solutions were used to provide the critical broadband network while Broadcom reference designs were used to demonstrate some new developments in customer premise or home networking. Finally Cisco System Network Registrar and Broadband Access Center provided the ever so critical provisioning services.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="352" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3SvhtLl8aTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Next up were two excellent demonstrations of customer premises or home networking technologies. First up was <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grundemann-homenet-hipnet">HIPnet</a> which is work that is currently being developed in cooperation with Cablelabs and was also presented during the IETF 86 HOMENET meeting. A Cablelabs implementation built upon open source software was demonstrated along with an implementation from Broadcom. For the first time ever both implementations were tested and interoperated successfully during the IETF 86 Bits-n-Bytes event.</p>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/homenet">HOMENET</a> implementations that were also tested during the IETF 85 Bits-n-Bytes also returned to participate in Orlando. Several implementations were tested and displayed, while connected to DOCSIS powered broadband network, illustrating arbitrary topologies and source and destination based routing. The value of this new technology is to enable automatically configured networks for IPv6-based homes, while allowing users to employ any number of routers, devices, ISP connections, and allowing them to be plugged in arbitrary ways.</p>
<p><iframe width="625" height="352" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NuHYOu4aAqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net">Buffer Bloat</a> has been a widely discussed topic across the community. Perhaps surprisingly, increased buffering memory in routers may reduce networking performance, particularly when the same routers serve both interactive applications and background traffic. End users see this problem as impacting broadband performance and increased response times. Working solutions for the issue made an appearance during the IETF 86 Bits-n-Bytes event. Bloated and de-bloated streaming video, games, and interactive communications provided evidence of running code that addresses the challenges of Buffer Bloat.</p>
<p>Finally, there were many other key participants including Nominum demonstrating their DNS and DHCP based solutions. In fact, Nominum&#8217;s DNS solution was providing name resolution for the Bits-n-Bytes broadband network. Huawei returned again with a prototype of a virtual subset and MPLS multiple topology technology. ISOC and ICANN were also present providing important information about their organizations as well as important background regarding the IETF as it relates to the Internet of today and tomorrow.</p>
