<pre>Hi Harald,

&gt; Overall comment: At first glance, it appears to be a move towards &quot;high 
&gt; ceremony&quot; standard-making. But the limited size and pragmatic guidelines 
&gt; might help us get away with it - after all, one should be able to write the 
&gt; first draft of a 5-page document in an afternoon!

The intention is not to make it 'high-ceremony' but more deterministic
with more explicit steps.  The IETF is a highly informal organization,
and informal organizations do suffer from scaling and expansion
problems.
 
&gt; It also appears to be somewhat misleading in its title - I'd see the making 
&gt; of quality plans as just one tool in the toolbox of &quot;going 
&gt; for quality&quot;.

I think that that is a reasonable criticism - this is just one aspect
of the quality mosiac.

&gt; Some comments while I'm reading:
&gt; 
&gt; - It adds new things to the WG charter: Individuals who have signed up to 
&gt; do work. This may be a good thing to do, but it seems odd to have this 
&gt; change in procedures for the charter buried inside the description of the 
&gt; quality plan. Also, it turns changes of personnel into charter revisions - which 
&gt; increases overhead.
&gt;
&gt; Might it be better to split this section into &quot;charter&quot; (as today) and 
&gt; &quot;resource plan&quot; (not only editors, but also committed reviewers)?

That might be a reasonable compromise.  One additional benefit is
this may provide some folks justification for participation to
their non-IETF managers.

&gt; - 2.3 introduces the review plan, which starts off with the challenge 
&gt; assessment review, whose purpose is to produce the challenge assessment 
&gt; section of this document. This seems to be a bit circular - are you 
&gt; assuming a model where the document starts out nearly empty, and then gets 
&gt; filled through review? if so, version control of the quality plan should be 
&gt; mentioned..... including the issue of who gets to approve it....

I need to come back to this point.

&gt; - the Last Call should be considered part of the review plan. I'd also 
&gt; expect the usefulness of issue trackers to grow larger near the end of a 
&gt; cycle; after all, &quot;this approach is hopeless&quot; (a natural early issue) is a 
&gt; hard issue to track, while &quot;the convergence time needs to be specified as 
&gt; 30 msecs, not 50&quot; is a very easy one to track.

Agreed, we can look at how to incorporate this.

&gt; - 3. post mortem. As we've observed before, the AD tends to &quot;marry&quot; the 
&gt; group's result in the end process. It might be better to have someone else 
&gt; do the quality asessment - after all, if the quality is lousy, but still 
&gt; gets out, we want to learn from that too: what were the circumstances that 
&gt; forced us to live with it?

Agreed.

John
