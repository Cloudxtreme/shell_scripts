<p>Japan Internet Exchange Co., Ltd. (JPIX) has been established in July 1997 for the purpose of providing neutral Internet traffic exchange services for Internet service providers and contents service providers, so that they can exchange traffic economically and effectively. The service was launched in November 1997 at the focal point of Japan's Internet traffic, KDDI Otemachi Building .</p>
<p>Internet exchange (IX) plays a very important role in supporting the Internet backbone. In Japan, WIDE, an academic organization of Widely Integrated Distributed Environments Project, has started the experimental IX called NSPIXP. This project has provided us a good example and has led us to the current successful and more reliable commercial IX service. JPIX has been attracting a lot of customers such as Japanese Tier 1 class ISPs and ISPs from overseas. Currently JPIX is one of the largest IX point here in the number of customers and volume of exchanged traffic. JPIX takes the social responsibility on running the heart of the Japanese Internet backbone.</p>
<p>For these years, we have expanded our IX to a "Metropolitan distributed IX ", whose IX sites are deployed at several data centers in Tokyo metropolitan area to avoid traffic centralization at Otemachi. In addition to the Tokyo metropolitan area, we have started two Regional IXs, "JPIX Nagoya" and "JPIX Osaka", to exchange traffic within local area. Furthermore, to meet the requirements of customers and new technologies, we have experimentally commenced an IX for IPv6 service to carry traffic of IPv6 that is going to be the standard protocol in next generation, and also commenced the Route Server service to reduce customer's operation involved in exchanging of routing information.</p>
<p>JPIX will make its best effort for further contribution to the growth of the Internet in our country by improving the service quality with state-of-the-art technologies and expanding the IX sites in order to satisfy the needs of the increasing Internet users and many upcoming data centers. We hope that you will continue to favor us with your generous support.<br /></p>
