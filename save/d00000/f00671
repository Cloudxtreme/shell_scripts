    <h3>Getting started with Tarsnap</h3>
    <div class="boxcontents">
      <p>
	Before you can use Tarsnap to store your backups, there are four
	steps which you have to complete:
      </p>
      <ol><li>
	Signing up for a Tarsnap account.
      </li><li>
	Installing the Tarsnap client code.
      </li><li>
	Depositing some money into your Tarsnap account.
      </li><li>
	Registering the machines on which you will be using Tarsnap.
      </li></ol>
      <p>
	Each of these steps are described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Sign up for a Tarsnap account</h4>
      <p>
	Go to the <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/register.cgi">Tarsnap
	registration page</a>, enter your email address, pick a password
	and enter it twice, and agree to the Tarsnap terms and conditions.
	Hit Submit.
      </p>
      <p>
	You will receive an email asking you to confirm your registration.
	(This serves two purposes:  First, it ensures that people don't
	mistype their email addresses; and second, it makes sure that people
	can't be registered against their will.)
      </p>
      <p>
	Follow the link provided in the registration confirmation email and
	type in your password again, and your account will be created.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Install the Tarsnap client code</h4>
      <p>
	Go to the <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/download.html">Tarsnap
	client code download page</a> and follow the instructions to download
	and install the Tarsnap client code.
      </p>
      <p>
	When Tarsnap is installed, a sample configuration file is installed
	into <tt>/usr/local/etc/tarsnap.conf.sample</tt>; you may wish to
	move or copy this to <tt>/usr/local/etc/tarsnap.conf</tt>.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Deposit funds into your account</h4>
      <p>
	Tarsnap operates on a prepaid basis (like many mobile phones), so
	you have to add funds to your account before you can use it.  To do
	this, log into the
	<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/manage.cgi">Tarsnap account
	management interface</a> and click on "Add funds to your account" to
	send in a payment of <b>$5 or more</b>.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Register machines</h4>
      <p>
	As part of the Tarsnap client code, there is a utility called
	<a href="man-tarsnap-keygen.1.html"><tt>tarsnap-keygen</tt></a>
	which registers a machine with the Tarsnap
	server.  This serves two purposes: First, because you have to enter
	your password (the one you set when you created your account), it
	confirms to the server that the machine's usage should be charged to
	your account; second, the <tt>tarsnap-keygen</tt> utility generates
	cryptographic keys used to encrypt and sign the machine's backups.
      </p>
      <p>
	To register a machine with the Tarsnap server, run
      </p>
<pre>tarsnap-keygen --keyfile /root/tarsnap.key --user me@example.com --machine mybox</pre>
      <p>
	(with appropriate values substituted) and enter your Tarsnap account
	password when prompted.  This will create a key file in
	<tt>/root/tarsnap.key</tt> which Tarsnap can use to store, restore,
	and delete archives.
	<b>STORE THIS FILE SOMEWHERE SAFE!</b>  Copy it to a different
	system, put it onto a USB disk, give it to a friend, print it out
	(it is printable text) and store it in a bank vault &mdash; there are
	lots of ways to keep it safe, but pick one and do it.  If you lose
	the Tarsnap key file, you will not be able to access your archived
	data.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you have multiple machines, you almost certainly want to create a
	separate key file for each machine.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Tarsnap</h4>
      <p>
	Once you've created key file(s), you're ready to start using Tarsnap.
	If you've ever used the UNIX <tt>tar</tt> utility, you'll probably be
	able to go from here on your own &mdash; if not, you may wish to read
	the <a href="usage.html">general usage</a> instructions or the
	<a href="man-tarsnap.1.html">Tarsnap man page</a>.
