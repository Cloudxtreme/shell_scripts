          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1887&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Earthquake science</strong></span><br />
         Earth
            Sciences professors set up the Western Hemisphere's first string
            of seismographic stations, to systematically record seismic
            activity and publish these earthquake records.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1892&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Sierra Club</strong></span><br />
          The
            Sierra Club is co-founded by John Muir; UC Berkeley professors
            Joseph LeConte, J. Henry Senger, and Cornelius Beach Bradley;
            Stanford University's David Starr Jordan; artist William Keith;
            and attorney Warren Olney. Many of the club's 182 charter members
            are scientists, and LeConte's maps of the Sierra range are
            among its first publications.            </p>
            
     
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1895&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Nutrition</strong></span><br /><img src="/img/history/timeline-fruits.jpg" alt=" grapes" width="50" height="50" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
           M.E. Jaffe becomes the first professor of nutrition in the United States. UC Berkeley quickly moves to the top in this field, making important contributions to the emerging understanding of the positive dietary role of vitamins, minerals, and protein, and the negative role of cholesterol and fats.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1904&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Rube Goldberg</strong></span><br />
            <a href="http://alumni.berkeley.edu/news/california-magazine/spring-2010-searchlight-gray-areas/cracked-slate">Rube Goldberg</a> receives his engineering degree. Goldberg subsequently achieves immortality, and a Pulitzer Prize, for his drawings making light of the discipline he studied. The cartoonist's absurdly complex mechanisms for accomplishing simple tasks have become so ingrained in popular culture that his name appears in the dictionary as an adjective.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/0102history.html">More</a> &gt;</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1907&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Cleaner smokestacks</strong></span><br />
            Frederick G. Cottrell, professor of chemistry, develops an
              electrical precipitation device to clean smokestack emissions;
              it is still in use today.</p>
<p><span class="subhead"><strong>1914-1920&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;      Yosemite wildlife survey </strong></span><a href="http://mvz.berkeley.edu/sounds/Russell_on_Grinnell.au"><img src="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/images/icons/audio_12.gif" alt="Au91dio" width="16" height="12" border="0" /></a><br />
  <img src="/img/history/timeline-grayowl.jpg" alt=" owl" width="50" height="50" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" />            Joseph
  Grinnell, the founding Director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology,
  and zoology professor Tracy Storer conduct a landmark survey of Sierra
  Nevada birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, from the Central Valley &nbsp;through
              Yosemite Valley to Mono Lake. This early work   makes
  it possible for subsequent generations to compare species diversity
  to the baseline data (see, for instance,
  the recent  <a href="http://mvz.berkeley.edu/Grinnell/index.html">Grinnell
              Resurvey Project</a>.) In a <a href="http://mvz.berkeley.edu/sounds/Russell_on_Grinnell.au">colorful
              audio narrative</a>, Ward Russell recounts what it was like
              to be in the field with Grinnell. <a href="http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/08/05_survey.shtml">More</a>              &gt;</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1922&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Vitamin E</strong></span><br />
            Anatomy professor Herbert M. Evans and Dr. Katharine S. Bishop co-discover vitamin E.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1924&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Deep-sea diving</strong></strong></span><br />
            Chemist Joel H. Hildebrand formulates a mixture of helium and oxygen for deep-sea diving, enabling divers to explore deeper into the sea than ever before, without experiencing the &quot;bends.&quot;</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1930s&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Fruit cocktail</strong></span><br />
            After working his way through school doing odd jobs, William (Vere) Cruess becomes a professor, a food technologist, and chair of the &quot;Division of Fruit Products&quot; at Berkeley. There he invents the canned-fruit cocktail. A <a href="http://digitalcollections.lrc.usuhs.mil/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16005coll2/id/879/rec/46" target="_blank">transcript</a> (PDF) of  Cruess's oral history, produced by the Regional Oral History Office, is online.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1930s&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistical theory</strong></span><br />
            Math professor Jerzy Neyman becomes one of the founders of modern statistical theory, whose applications range from designing the census to assessing the outcome of medical trials. With British statistician Egon Pearson, Neyman develops a method for choosing the most effective test of a hypothesis, and later develops foundational statistical-theory concepts.&nbsp; <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/history">More</a> &gt; </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1931&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                The cyclotron</strong></span><br /><img src="/img/history/timeline-lawrence.jpg" alt=" Ernest Lawrence" width="50" height="50" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
            Ernest O. Lawrence designs the first cyclotron, launching the
              scientific use of particle physics to discover the fundamental
              structure of matter. The cyclotron has a major impact on
              the treatment of diseases, making it possible to create in
              large quantities the radioactive isotopes used in medical
              treatments. In 1939, Lawrence becomes UC Berkeley's first
              Nobel laureate.&nbsp; <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1939/lawrence-bio.html">More</a> &gt; </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1935&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Vitamin K</strong></span><br />
            Herman J. Almquist with Berkeley's Division of Poultry Husbandry
              discovers and synthesizes vitamin K, a biomolecule necessary
              for blood to clot properly. The manuscript announcing the
              discovery is rejected by <em>Science </em>magazine, creating
              a critical delay that allows Henrik Dam of Copenhagen to
              beat Almquist to publication and become known as the vitamin's
              discoverer.&nbsp; <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/117/3/409.pdf">More</a> &gt; </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1937&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Nuclear medicine</strong></span><br />
            John Lawrence, Ernest Lawrence's brother and the director of Berkeley's Donner Lab, becomes the father of nuclear medicine. In 1937 in the first use of radioisotopes to control disease, Lawrence treats individuals suffering from polycythemia vera (over-abundance of red blood cells) with doses of radio-pharmaceuticals; use of iodine to diagnose and treat hyperthyroidism follows.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1940s&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Carbon-14 and photosynthesis</strong></span><br />
            A team led by chemist Melvin Calvin resolves the riddle of photosynthesis, tracing the pathways by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. As part of this effort, Calvin discovers that carbon-14 can be used as a molecular tracer, and uses it to reveal the path of carbon as it travels through a plant. In 1961, Calvin is awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1961/calvin-bio.html">More</a> &gt;  </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1940s&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Flu vaccine</strong></span><br />
            The influenza-virus vaccine is developed during World War II by biochemist Wendell M. Stanley and colleagues.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1941&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Transuranic elements</strong></span><br /><img src="/img/history/timeline-seaborg.jpg" alt=" Glenn Seaborg" width="50" height="50" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
            Using the cyclotron, plutonium is produced by professors <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/seaborg-bio.html">Glenn
            T. Seaborg</a> and <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/mcmillan-bio.html">Edwin
            McMillan</a> and colleagues. For this work, Seaborg and McMillan
            share the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Plutonium is one of
            16 elements to be discovered at UC Berkeley and the Lawrence
            Berkeley National Laboratory. </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1943&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                The atomic bomb</strong></span><br />
            During World War II, UC directs operation of the U.S. government laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, incorporating work by Berkeley faculty and others to develop the atomic bomb. The laboratory is directed by physics professor J. Robert Oppenheimer.</p>
<p><span class="subhead"><strong>1944&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;      Bovine-growth hormone</strong></span><br />
            Bovine-growth hormone is first purified by the Institute of Experimental Biology's Herbert Evans and Choh Hao Li<strong> </strong>paving the way for the purification of human-growth hormone and, 30 years later, the cloning of human-growth hormone by scientists at UC San Francisco.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1947-1955&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Lipoproteins
                and heart disease</strong></span><br /><img src="/img/history/timeline-heart45.jpg" alt=" heart" width="45" height="45" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"> 
            <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/09/04_GofmanObit.shtml">John
            Gofman</a>, medical physics professor, and his former doctoral
            students Frank Lindgren and Alex Nichols, discover and name
            the various lipoprotein classes &mdash; such as low-density
            lipoproteins (LDL), today referred to as &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol,
            and &quot;good&quot; high-density lipoproteins (HDL) &mdash; and
            discover the role of LDL and HDL in heart disease. The ratio
            of HDL to LDL is a strong indicator of heart-disease risk,
            they report. Gofman and Nichols also conduct dietary studies
            showing that people respond differently to diets high in fat
            and cholesterol, depending on their lipoprotein profiles.</p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1951&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Insect control</strong></span><br />
            Professor Edward Steinhaus, a pioneer in the field of insect pathology, uses bacteria to attack a caterpillar that infests alfalfa. This is the first successful use of an insect pathogen to control insects in the field. Today these bacteria, <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>, are used worldwide to fight crop disease; the bacteria secrete a toxin that kills insects, and genetic-engineering companies insert the gene for this toxin into plants, producing crops with a built-in insect resistance. </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1952&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;                Wetsuits</strong></span><br />
            Physicist Hugh Bradner invents the first wetsuit. The new protective garment helps to spawn new sports such as board sailing and body boarding; transform commercial, military, and recreational deep-sea diving; and advance understanding of oceans. </p>
          <p><span class="subhead"><strong>1954&nbsp; The polio virus</strong></span><br />

            Higher Education. Its chief architect is UC President Clark
            Kerr</a>, an industrial-relations expert who served as Berkeley's
            first chancellor from 1952 to 1958. Clark's education blueprint
            promises California students from all walks of life, regardless
            of financial means, access to college; the Master Plan continues
            to guide the state's public higher education to this day and

            Herma Hill Kay, a faculty member at Boalt Hall, co-drafts California's 1970 no-fault divorce law, the first of its kind in the nation. The law eliminates the need to place blame on a spouse for a failed marriage and makes &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; sufficient ground for divorce. Eventually, every state in the nation enacts some version of no-fault divorce. Kay later serves as the first female dean of the law school (1992-2000).</p>

            Biochemist Allan Wilson founds the field of molecular evolution,
              using genetic material, rather than fossils, to investigate
              the origins of humanity. In 1967, Wilson and doctoral student
              Vincent Sarich show that proteins evolve and change as life
              evolves, and consequently can serve as a &quot;molecular
              clock&quot; to measure the evolutionary relationships between
              animals, such as between gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans.
              In the early 1980s, Wilson and colleagues defy conventional
              thinking (which dates human origins to some 25 million years
              ago); they trace humans back to common ancestors in
              sub-Saharan Africa some 200,000 years ago. Today, scientists
              compare DNA to determine evolutionary family trees.</p>

In 1971, Berkeley Professor Bob Fabry buys a $99 copy of UNIX and provides it to a group of students, including Bill Joy, who modify the original code to include a number of new features. In 1977, Joy releases Berkeley UNIX under the Berkeley Software Distribution moniker, and encourages a world of hackers   to improve it. The team incorporates these upgrades into future releases &mdash; creating a revolutionary new paradigm for software development and distribution, now known as Open Source, which makes source code available for anyone to build upon and improve. <a href="http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/history_unix.html">More</a> &gt;</p>
