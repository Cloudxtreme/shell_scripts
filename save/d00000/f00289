<p>This is the community Internet domain for Trumansburg NY.</p>
<p>Back in the 1990s, 
all names in the .US (United States) domain had to 
use geographic names of the form</p>
<center><em>&lt;name&gt;</em>.<em>&lt;place&gt;</em>.<em>&lt;st&gt;</em>.US.</center>
<p>In many places, local <i>community registrars</i> volunteered to handle
the registrations for a community.
In 2001, the rules for .US were changed to allow arbitrary names, but
many of the existing community registrars are still active.
</p>
<p>Trumansburg still has a community registrar, so
you can still register <tt><i>name</i>.trumansburg.ny.us</tt>
domains <i>at no charge</i>.</p>
<p>Registrations are handled by e-mail. If you are interested in registering
a domain, write to <tt>hostmaster@trumansburg.ny.us</tt> and
include:
<ul><li>The name of the domain you'd like to register</li>
<li>Your name and postal address</li>
<li>Your connection with the community, if it's not self-evident</li>
<li>The names of your DNS name servers</li>
</ul>
