      <p><b><a name="A"></a>A. Code of Ethics for NomCom Members</b></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><b><a name="A1"></a>1. Scope</b></p>

         This Code of Ethics applies to and must be agreed to by: 
		<ul>
          <li>any and all ICANN Nominating Committee (NomCom) members,</li>
          <li>any and all ICANN staff members engaged in supporting the work of 
            the Nominating Committee, and</li>
          <li>any and all outside consultants who may be retained by the Nominating 
            Committee to assist with any phase of its work.</li>
        </ul>
		<p><b><a name="A2"></a>2. Integrity and Conflict of Interest</b></p>

        <p>NomCom members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet 
          community and within the scope of the ICANN mission and responsibilities 
          assigned to it by the ICANN Bylaws. The NomCom is designed to function 
          independently from the ICANN Board, the Supporting Organizations, and 
          Advisory Committees.</p>

        <p>NomCom members are expected to adhere to the ICANN Conflict of Interest 
          Policy. Each NomCom member must disclose promptly to the Chair any financial 
          or other relations that might affect (or might reasonably be seen to 
          affect) his/her performance on the Committee, including any financial 
          connections to any individual under consideration by the NomCom. A subcommittee 
          will be formed by the Chair to review disclosed conflicts or potential 
          conflicts and to determine how to handle them. NomCom members must recuse 
          themselves from participation in discussion and voting where such conflict 
          exists.</p>
		 <p>NomCom members must not have any pre-existing commitments concerning the nomination of any particular candidates or potential candidates.</p>
        <p>Each NomCom member is expected to pursue the stated objectives of the Committee, to comply with the rules and procedures established by the Committee, and to support the decisions the Committee makes.</p>
		<p>Each NomCom member is expected to do his/her best to find the highest-qualified candidates for consideration by the NomCom, and to do his/her best to encourage those individuals to serve.</p>
		<p>At no time shall any member of NomCom act in a way that would bring the Committee into disrepute or undermine the integrity of the process by which the Committee makes its selections.</p>
	
		<p><b><a name="A3"></a>3. Confidentiality and Privacy</b></p>

        <p>All NomCom members will safeguard all internal NomCom communications 
          and treat them as strictly private, confidential, and for the use of 
          immediate committee members and NomCom staff only, without exception.</p>
		  <p>NomCom members will not disclose outside of the Committee any of the discussions about the candidates. Further, NomCom members will not disclose outside of the Committee the identities of candidates under consideration by NomCom, unless NomCom as a whole has decided to do so and the explicit consent of the candidate(s) in question has been obtained.</p>

		<p>At the conclusion of the NomCom process, the Chair, who will serve as
Advisor to the next NomCom, will seek the consent of unsuccessful candidates
for his restricted retention of their names and email addresses for the
limited purpose of alerting them when the next NomCom announces its Formal
Call for Statements of Interest and Recommendations.  No other information
for individual candidates will be retained. In particular, candidates from
the 2004 process who wish to be candidates in the next NomCom process will
need to submit a new Statement of Interest.</p>
		 <p>Participation on the NomCom is limited to the NomCom member, and cannot include a NomCom’s assistant, other staff, or proxy. </p>
		 <p>Should a NomCom member withdraw, step down, or be removed from the NomCom, he or she is obligated to delete and destroy any and all NomCom-related materials and communications. </p>

	<p><b><a name="A4"></a>4. Agreement to Adhere to the Code of Ethics</b></p>
		<p>Failure to agree to Adhere to the Code of Ethics  will constitute grounds for removal from the NomCom.</p>
	
      </blockquote>

      <p><b><a name="B"></a>B. NomCom's Role and Objectives</b></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b><a name="B1"></a>1. Role</b></p>

        <p>NomCom is responsible for the selection of portions of the members 
          of the ICANN Board of Directors, GNSO Council, Interim ALAC, and ccNSO 
          Council, filling these leadership positions in a way that complements 
          the selections made for such positions by the Supporting Organizations 
          and Interim ALAC.</p>

        <p>The central rationale for using a nominating committee to select a 
          portion of the ICANN leadership bodies is to balance those who can represent 
          particular areas of knowledge and interests with those who place the 
          broad public interest of the global Internet community ahead of any 
          particular interests. NomCom’s role is to select individuals of the 
          highest integrity and capability who place the broad public interest 
          of the global Internet community ahead of any particular interests, 
          and who are nevertheless knowledgeable about ICANN’s mission and environment. 
        </p>

        <p>To achieve this broad public-interest orientation, the members of NomCom 
          are drawn from across the ICANN and global Internet communities. They 
          act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet community 
          within the scope of the ICANN mission and the responsibilities assigned 
          to NomCom by ICANN Bylaws. They act as individuals and are not beholden 
          to their appointing constituencies as they work by consensus to derive 
          the NomCom slates of Selected Nominees for these leadership bodies.</p>

        <p>The NomCom functions independently from the ICANN Board, Supporting 
          Organizations, and Advisory Committees. The NomCom selections are final; 
          no further approval or ratification is needed.</p>
		<p>Together the NomCom and Supporting Organization selection pathways ensure that ICANN benefits from functional, cultural, geographic diversity in its policy development and decision-making as the Internet evolves.</p>
		<p>NomCom is responsible for the selection of all ICANN Directors except 
          the President and those selected by ICANN's Supporting Organizations, 
          and for such other selections as are set forth in the Bylaws. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1">Bylaws 
          Article VII, Section 1</a>] </p>


        <p><b><a name="B2"></a>2. Objectives</b></p>

        <p>The following are the core objectives of the NomCom:</p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p>1. Identify, recruit, and nominate the highest-quality nominees for 

            the positions NomCom is charged to fill;</p>

          <p>2. Advance the core mission and values of ICANN [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#I">Bylaws 

            Article I, Sections 1 and 2</a>];</p>

          <p>3. Trust and respect all members of the NomCom;</p>

          <p>4. Pursue diversity in geography, culture, skills, experience, and 

            perspectives from across the global Internet community;</p>

          <p>5. Earn trust and respect of the Internet community by acting with 

            fairness and integrity, and by providing transparency of objectives, 

            criteria, procedures, and mechanisms for receiving input, while respecting 

            candidates’ privacy and maintaining the confidentiality that is necessary 

            to assure open and frank communications within NomCom; and </p>

          <p>6. Adhere to the ICANN Bylaws.</p>

      <p><b><a name="C"></a>C. NomCom Operating Procedures</b></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b><a name="C1"></a>1. Modifications to NomCom Procedures</b></p>

        <p>Considerable care has been taken in developing the NomCom Procedures. 
          The NomCom process, however, is new to ICANN. In setting and publicizing 
          its procedures, the NomCom reserves the right to modify them in the 
          course of its work in order to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in 
          fulfilling its responsibilities. If NomCom concludes that modification 
          of these procedures is necessary, NomCom will post the changes on the 
          NomCom web page.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C2"></a>2. Responsibilities of NomCom Members</b></p>

        <p>NomCom members are expected to engage in outreach, recruitment, and 
          information gathering; to read the submitted and gathered information 
          about each candidate under consideration; to participate in both deliberations 
          about individual candidates and construction of slates of candidates 
          that will fulfill the requirements for each of the leadership bodies 
          for which NomCom selects members; to participate in NomCom teleconferences; 
          to work diligently with NomCom colleagues toward an overall consensus 
          on the best possible group of candidates to be selected; and to adhere 
          to the Code of Ethics.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C3"></a>3. Vacancies and Removal from NomCom</b><br>
          <br>
          Vacancies that may occur in NomCom may be filled for the remainder of 
          the term vacated by the same means by which the position was initially 
          filled. In the event that a NomCom member is removed for any reason, 
          he/she is obligated to delete all NomCom-related material. In the event 
          that a member of the NomCom staff is removed for any reason, he/she 
          is obligated to arrange for secure transfer of all NomCom-related material 
          to a NomCom designated person, and then to delete all NomCom-related 
          material from his/her own records in any form.</p>

        <p>A NomCom member may be removed, following notice to the member, and 
          if selected by a Supporting Organization constituency or Advisory Committee, 
          after notice to that Supporting Organization constituency or Advisory 
          Committee, by a majority vote of all NomCom members entitled to vote; 
          provided, however, that the member who is the subject of the removal 
          action shall not be entitled to vote on such an action or be counted 
          as a voting member of NomCom when calculating the required majority 
          vote; and provided further, that each vote to remove a member shall 
          be a separate vote on the sole question of the removal of that particular 
          member.</p>
		<p>A member of the NomCom staff may be removed by the Chair of NomCom, following notice to the ICANN CEO.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C4"></a>4. Language for Conduct of NomCom's Communications</b></p>

        <p>NomCom will conduct its communications in English.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C5"></a>5. Terminology</b></p>

        <p>The term &quot;Candidate&quot; will be reserved for those individuals 
          who agree to be considered by the NomCom for whom all required information 
          in the Statement of Interest has been received.</p>

        <p>The term &quot;Selected Nominee&quot; is reserved to refer to a Candidate 
          selected by NomCom for a position it is charged to fill. NomCom selections 
          are final; no further approval or ratification is needed.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C6"></a>6. Internal Communications and Relations</b></p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p> <i><a name="C6a"></a>a. Communications and Meetings</i></p>

          <p>NomCom will carry out its work primarily through teleconferences 
            and email. Materials for NomCom’s work should normally be distributed 
            at least 48 hours in advance of teleconference meetings.</p>

          <p>The Chair will seek to facilitate confidential communications in 
            a way that makes the most sense for the NomCom members.</p>
		<p>The Nominating Committee expects to hold a face-to-face meeting in August-September at a location to be announced. NomCom members are encouraged, but not required to travel to face-to-face meetings, and provisions for participation via teleconference  will be arranged for members unable to attend in person. Reimbursement of necessary expenses  will be available for travel to face-to-face meetings, in accord with applicable terms of  ICANN travel reimbursement policy.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C6b"></a>b. Volunteer Service</i></p>

          <p>NomCom members serve as volunteers, without compensation. This contribution 
            is respected and appreciated. Provisions will be made to alleviate 
            the financial burden of the NomCom’s frequent teleconferences. Without 
            prior approval from the Chair for the incurrence of expenditure, reimbursement 
            will not be made for any other expenditures.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C6c"></a>c. Non-Voting Members</i></p>

          <p>Except for formal votes, non-voting members of the NomCom will take 
            part in all NomCom activities on an equal basis with voting members.</p>

          <p>All NomCom members may participate in all discussions and deliberations 
            (unless a conflict of interest has been determined to be present).</p>

          <p><i><a name="C6d"></a>d. Access to Information</i></p>

          <p>The Chair will maintain a non-public central file of Candidates under 
            consideration, including available background, professional information, 
            and gathered information. All NomCom members will have access to the 
            information in the central file. The central file is confidential 
            to NomCom members and NomCom staff.</p>
	<p>At the conclusion of the NomCom process, the Chair, who will serve as
Advisor to the next NomCom,  will seek the consent of unsuccessful
candidates for his restricted retention of their names and email addresses
for the limited purpose of alerting them when the next NomCom announces its
Formal Call for Statements of Interest and Recommendations. No other
information for individual candidates will be retained. In particular,
candidates from the 2004 process who wish to be candidates in the next
NomCom process will need to submit a new Statement of Interest.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C7"></a>7. External Communications and Relations</b></p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i><a name="C7a"></a>a. Transparency</i></p>

          <p>The NomCom will publish its rules and procedures at its web page 
            on the ICANN Website. In consultation with the NomCom, the Chair will 
            establish and publicize milestones and deadlines, including the public 
            call for recommendations, so as to allow the NomCom to complete its 
            work in a timely way. 
          </p>
		<p>The Chair will serve as the official spokesperson for NomCom.</p>
		
          <p><i><a name="C7b"></a></i>b. Recruitment Consultations</p>

          <p>The NomCom will engage proactively in consultations with the various 
            elements of the ICANN community in its recruitment efforts. Such contacts 
            will include the IETF, the DNS root name server operators, the regional 
            Internet registries, the Address Council, the gTLD and ccTLD registries 
            and registrars, the Council and constituencies of the GNSO, the Council 
            and constituencies of the ccNSO, the technical liaison group and the 
            Security and At Large Advisory Committees.</p>

          <p>The success of the NomCom will depend in no small measure on the 
            willingness and ability of NomCom members to engage in affirmative 
            recruitment of excellent candidates. The NomCom will use all readily 
            available means to publicize the call for Recommendations and Statements 
            of Interest.</p>

          <p>In order to encourage NomCom members do their best to identify and 
            recruit outstanding candidates, each NomCom member will be asked to 
            present a list of several possible candidates for each of the bodies 
            to be populated in part by the NomCom. </p>

          <p><i><a name="C7c"></a>c. Public Input</i></p>

          <p>The NomCom will call publicly for Recommendations and Statements 
            of Interest from across the global Internet community to find the 
            talent and experience needed for the positions it fills, to inform 
            NomCom’s decisions, and to generate the confidence and respect of 
            the community for those whom NomCom selects.</p>

          <p>The NomCom will use all readily available means to publicize the 
            call for Recommendations and Statements of Interest.</p>

          <p>NomCom will seek Recommendations of potential candidates to enlarge 
            and enhance the pool of candidates. A Recommendation, however, is 
            not a requirement for consideration by the NomCom.</p>

          <p>The Chair will give at least 30 days for the public to submit Recommendations 
            and Statements of Interest.</p>

          <p>Because NomCom will conduct its work in English, all submissions 
            to NomCom must be provided in English. In NomCall's Formal Call for 
            Recommendations and Statements of Interest NomCom grants permission 
            for translation of the Formal Call provided (1) any distributed translation 
            includes the full text of the Formal Call in English in its entirety

          <p>All Recommendations and Statements of Interest will be acknowledged 
            in a timely fashion, using the address information provided by the 
            submitter.</p>

          <p>NomCom will provide a one-way communication mechanism (email or web-based) 
            through which the public can easily provide input to assist the NomCom 
            in its work. See section d below regarding the confidential treatment 
            of input received about specific candidates via this mechanism.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C7d"></a>d. Confidentiality and Privacy</i></p>

          <p>All NomCom members and NomCom staff will safeguard all internal NomCom 
            communications and treat them as strictly private, confidential, and 
            for the use of immediate committee members and NomCom staff only, 
            without exception.</p>

          <p>Communications of the NomCom are limited to the NomCom members and 
            NomCom staff, and cannot include a NomCom member’s assistant, or other 
            staff. </p>

          <p>NomCom members and NomCom staff will not disclose outside of the 
            committee the identities of Candidates under consideration by the 
            NomCom, nor any discussions about them, unless both the Candidate 
            and the NomCom as a whole have given explicit authorization to disclose 
            the information.</p>

          <p>Note that because NomCom will need to check references and consult 
            selected third-party sources on a confidential basis before making 
            its final selections, those wishing to be considered Candidates are 
            required to confirm this understanding of the confidentiality arrangements 
            when they submit a Statement of Interest. NomCom also reserves the 
            right to disclose the identities of those who submit Recommendations 
            when it is necessary to do so in the course of the review process.</p>

          <p>When NomCom has completed its selection of Nominees for the positions 
            it is charged to fill, NomCom will, of course, publish the identities 
            of the Selected Nominees.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C8"></a>8. Criteria for Selection for ICANN Directors, 
          GNSO Council Members, Interim ALAC Members, and ccNSO Council Members</b></p>

        <p>The NomCom will apply the criteria for selection and terms of eligibility, 
          defined in the applicable ICANN Bylaws, to identify a strong pool of 
          qualified Candidates who meet the highest standards of integrity and 
          capability.</p>

        <p>To select from this pool of qualified Candidates, NomCom will take 
          into account additional considerations, related to the roles to be filled, 
          that it finds important as progress in the selection process is made.</p>

        <p>By doing so, the NomCom seeks to ensure that ICANN can benefit from 
          those who place the public interest of the global Internet community 
          ahead of any particular special interests, but who nevertheless are 
          or commit themselves to becoming knowledgeable about the environment 
          in which ICANN operates.</p>

        <p>In doing so, the NomCom also implements <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I-2.4">ICANN's 
          Core Values</a> to seek and support broad, informed participation reflecting 
          the functional, geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at 
          all levels of policy development and decision-making.</p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i><a name="C8a"></a>a. Roles of the Positions to Be Filled</i></p>

          <p>NomCom will be selecting its Nominees with careful consideration 
            of the roles they fill:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>ICANN's Directors, as a group, are responsible for exercising 
              the powers of ICANN, controlling its property, and conducting or 
              directing its business and affairs, except as otherwise provided 
              in the ICANN Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. Directors serve 
              as individuals who have the duty to act in what they reasonably 
              believe are the best interests of ICANN and not as representatives 
              of the entity that selected them, their employers, or any other 
              organizations or constituencies. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#II-1">Bylaws 
              Article II, section 1</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-7">Article 
              VI, Section 7</a>]</li>
            <li>The GNSO Council is responsible for managing the policy development 
              process of the GNSO. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#X-3.4">Bylaws 
              Article X, Section 3(4)</a>]</li>
            <li>The Interim ALAC is to consider and provide advice on the activities 
              of ICANN, insofar as they relate to the interests of individual 
              users. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#XI-2.4">Bylaws 
              Article XI, Section 2(4)</a>] </li>
            <li>The ccNSO Council is responsible for managing the policy-development 
              process of the ccNSO. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/IX-3">Bylaws 
              Article IX, Section 3(8)</a>]</li>
          </ul>

          <p>NomCom will use for all of these positions the criteria in the Bylaws 
            for selection of ICANN Directors. See below. NomCom may use some additional 
            considerations for the GNSO Council and Interim ALAC, and ccNSO Council 
            positions to support the specific roles of these entities.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C8b"></a>b. Criteria for Selection of ICANN Directors</i></p>

          <p>&quot;ICANN Directors shall be:</p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p>(i). Accomplished persons of integrity, objectivity, and intelligence, 
              with reputations for sound judgment and open minds, and a demonstrated 
              capacity for thoughtful group decision-making;</p>

            <p>(ii). Persons with an understanding of ICANN's mission and the 
              potential impact of ICANN decisions on the global Internet community, 
              and committed to the success of ICANN;</p>

            <p>(iii). Persons who will produce the broadest cultural and geographic 
              diversity on the Board consistent with meeting the other criteria 
              set forth in this Section;</p>

            <p>(iv) Persons who, in the aggregate, have personal familiarity with 
              the operation of gTLD registries and registrars; with ccTLD registries; 
              with IP address registries; with Internet technical standards and 
              protocols; with policy-development procedures, legal traditions, 
              and the public interest; and with the broad range of business, individual, 
              academic, and non-commercial users of the Internet;</p>

            <p>(v). Persons who are willing to serve as volunteers, without compensation 
              other than the reimbursement of certain expenses; and</p>

            <p>(vi) Persons who are able to work and communicate in written and 
              spoken English.&quot; [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-3">Bylaws 
              Article VI, Sec. 3</a>]</p>

          </blockquote>

			<p>It is understood that the criteria of cultural and geographic diversity as reflected in (iii) above includes gender, ethnic, religious, or other forms of diversity. </p>
          <p><i><a name="C8c"></a>c. Additional Considerations for GNSO, ALAC 
            and ccNSO Positions </i></p>

          <p>The criteria for selection of the GNSO Council, ccNSO Council, and 
            At Large Advisory Committee members are less specifically defined 
            in the Bylaws, but the NomCom notes the "Legislative History" behind 
            the decision for NomCom to select some individuals to the above committees. 
            [<a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/evol-reform/blueprint-20jun02.htm#3">ICANN: 
            A Blueprint for Reform, Section 3</a> (20 June 2002) and <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/evol-reform/final-implementation-report-02oct02.htm#GNSO">Final 
            Implementation Report and Recommendations, Section 3(C)</a> (2 October 
            2002)]</p>

          <p>NomCom is looking for women and men who have demonstrated the maturity, 
            experience, knowledge and skills to handle the tasks and make the 
            judgments involved in fulfilling the roles of Board Directors, GNSO 
            Council Members, ccNSO Council Members, and Interim ALAC Members.</p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p><a name="C8ci"></a>(i) Additional Considerations for the GNSO Council 
              Positions</p>

            <p>For the GNSO Council positions, specific experience related to 
              the scope of GNSO's work with the Domain Name System would be advantageous. 
            </p>

            <p><a name="C8cii" id="C8cii"></a>(ii) Additional Considerations for 
              the Interim ALAC Positions</p>

            <p>For the Interim ALAC positions, experience and skills that bear 
              on gathering, understanding, and communicating the interests of 
              individual users would be advantageous. Perspectives not otherwise 
              reflected in the existing Interim ALAC membership would be advantageous. 
              NomCom's selections for Interim ALAC are intended to diversify the 
              skill and experience sets of the Interim ALAC, including in such 
              areas as group decision-making. Over time these NomCom selections 
              present an opportunity to connect with the interests of individual 
              users from all categories.</p>
		<p><a name="C8ciii" id="C8ciii"></a>(iii) Additional Considerations for the ccNSO Council Positions</p>
			  
		<p>For the ccNSO Council positions, while no specific considerations are reflected in the Bylaws, experience or knowledge of ccTLDs and issues of importance to the global Internet, would be advantageous. Additionally, familiarity of the global environment in which ICANN operates and perspectives not otherwise reflected in the ccTLD community would be likewise be advantageous.</p>

              of Directors (not including the President) who are citizens of countries 
              in any one Geographic Region to exceed five; and the NomCom shall

        <p><b><a name="C10"></a>10. Review and Evaluation of Candidates</b></p>

        <p>NomCom expects to complete its selection of Nominees for all of the 
          positions it is charged to fill in 2004 in time for those selected to 
          be seated at the conclusion of the ICANN 2004 Annual Meeting.</p>

        <p>NomCom will post on the NomCom webpage a Work Plan with identified 
          Milestones. NomCom reserves the right to adjust its schedule within 
          the boundaries of the Bylaw requirements. Adjustments in NomCom's schedule 
          will be posted on its webpage and to subscribers to &lt;<a href="mailto:nomcom.announce-request@icann.org">nomcom.announce-request@icann.org</a>&gt;.</p>

        <p>Additional information on the 2004 Nominating Committee process will 
          be included in the Formal Call for Recommendations and Statements of 
          Interest which will be posted on the NomCom webpage. </p>

        <p>NomCom will begin its review of Candidate information contained in 
          the completed Statement of Interest as soon as it is received and confirmed 
          to have all required information.</p>

        <p>The NomCom will evaluate Candidates in a fair and consistent manner, 
          considering the Statement of Interest, references and, as needed, interviews, 
          consultations, and third-party information sources. While doing so, 
          it will adhere to its <a href="ethics-2004.html">Code 
          of Ethics</a>.</p>

        <p>See also Section 8 above which describes the criteria and additional 
          considerations that will be taken into account in NomCom's selections. 
          Section 9 describes the eligibility factors.</p>

        <p>Note that endorsements by organizations or groups and lists of signatories 
          are not appropriate for this NomCom process, and they will not be influential 
          in NomCom's selections since popularity is not one of the criteria being 
          used.</p>

        <p>NomCom will need to carry out due diligence regarding candidates it 
          wishes to consider in the final round of review. For this purpose NomCom 
          will arrange, with consent of these candidates, to conduct confidential 
          references and credential verification and consult with others, not 
          named by the Candidate, on a confidential basis.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that this Nominating Committee process differs from 
          an election, although the goal is the same: to elicit the Internet community's 
          participation in a thoughtful process leading to the selection of very 
          well-qualified individuals to fulfill the specific roles of their positions.</p>
