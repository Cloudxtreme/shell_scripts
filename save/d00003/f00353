<p>
<!-- <font size=+1> -->
<hr>
<p>
During the RFC editing process, the RFC Editor strives for quality,
clarity, and consistency of style and format.  In its long history the
RFC series evolved a particular editorial style.  The RFC Editor is
conservative about maintaining this style and the procedures that
produce it, but new situations sometimes lead to new editorial
guidelines and procedures.
<P>
This page summarizes relatively recent
changes, which have been adopted after consultation with the IESG and
IAB.  These changes will be incorporated into the revised Style Guide and
associated web site as soon as they are published.
<P>
We ask the cooperation of the community in helping us to implement
these guidelines, which should result in better quality RFCs for all.

Authors vs. Contributors
</H3></a>
<P>
Questions are still arising about the editorial policies on RFC
authorship, and the contents of the first page, of the Contributors
section, and of the Authors' Address section.  We will attempt to
clarify.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
When the RFC Editor refers to "authors", we mean exactly the
	set of names listed on the first page of an RFC.

	These people are considered to be equally responsible for the
	contents of the document, and all will be asked to read and
	approve the RFC before publication.
<P>
<LI>
When the RFC Editor refers to "contributors", we mean people,
	other than the authors, who also contributed significantly
	to the RFC.  They should be listed in a Contributors
	section of the body of the document.
<P>
<LI>
The last section of the document has traditionally been a section listing
contact information for authors. The intent of this section is to tell readers
how to get in touch with those people responsible for the document, to seek
clarification, make comments, etc. This section should include contact
information for all authors. This section has been titled "Author's Address"
(or "Authors' Addresses").

<P>
<LI>
The issue has arisen: can/should the Contributors section
	include contact information?  The answer is yes, it may
	include contact information at the authors' discretion.

Do-Not-Publish-Now Requests
</H3></a>

In addition to RFCs generated by the IETF process and approved by the
IESG, the RFC Editor publishes independent submissions that are
technically competent and relevant to the general subject area of the
series.  The RFC Editor has primary responsibility to determine
publishability of independent submissions, but the IESG does review them
to ensure they are not in conflict with any ongoing standardization
efforts in the IETF [RFC 2026].
<P>
The procedure has been that the IESG could recommend for or against
publication of an independent submission.  Although the RFC Editor
formally has the final decision, in practice the RFC Editor very seldom
goes against a Do Not Publish (DNP) request from the IESG, and if they
do, they attach a prominent "IESG Note" to the RFC.  The RFC Editor is
governed by the requirement that independent submission publication
must not provide an end-run around the standards process.
<P>
Recently, an increasing number of independent submissions have been for
publication of technical proposals that have been rejected by some
working group.  This raises a dilemma.  Archival documentation of
legitimate alternative ideas is generally a long-term benefit to the
community.  On the other hand, some users don't read warning labels, so
a competing idea published as an independent submission might gain
credence outside the IETF before the working group's work has
completed.
<P>
To balance these competing demands, the IESG and the RFC Editor have
developed the following modification to the procedure for reviewing
independent submissions.  This procedure is provisional; it may be
modified if it does not meet its objectives.
<P>
When the IESG determines that immediate publication of an independent
submission conflicts with an ongoing IETF working group activity, the
IESG may recommend to the RFC Editor "do not publish (DNP) at this
time" and cite the working group.  The RFC Editor will then delay
publication for an initial six-month period.  The author will be notified
that their document will not be published at present but they may
re-submit the document six months later.  (It is the author's
responsibility to retain a copy of the DNP email and include it with
subsequent submissions; i.e., the author holds the timer state.)
<P>
If the author does resubmit after six months, the same process will be
repeated.  The IESG can recommend "DNP at this time" a second time,
creating a second six-month delay.  If the author still wishes to
publish the document, it may be submitted a third time.  At this time,
the IESG may recommend an advisory note be added to the document, but
no additional "DNP at this time" delays will be allowed.  Thus, working
groups are protected from possibly competing publications for up to one
year.  Note that if the IESG requests it, the RFC Editor will include
an IESG Note on the front page of the published RFC, which can give the
IESG's opinion about the status of the document in relation to the IETF
process.

Copyright statement in MIB and PIB Modules
</H3></a>

At the request of the IESG, and immediately effective, the RFC Editor
will be placing a copyright statement into all MIB and PIB modules.
<P>
Many people/tools extract the MIB or PIB modules out of our
RFCs that contain a MIB or PIB module. In most cases they
remove the copyright information that is part of the RFC.
This is against the IETF copyright claim.
<P>
People/tools do this not with bad intentions. The reason they
do not extract the copyright info is because it is not in machine
readable/parsable form, and they want the MIB or PIB modules to
feed them into their agents, network management platforms, or
other MIB or PIB tools.
<P>                             
In order to ensure that the copyright statement is properly
preserved and included in extracted MIB and PIB modules, and in
order to make it easier for people/tools to keep the proper
copyright when extracting MIB or PIB modules, the IESG has
agreed with the the RFC-Editor that:
<P>                             
The RFC-Editor, during the editing process of an RFC that
contains a MIB or a PIB Module, copies a short copyright
statement into the DESCRIPTION clause of the MODULE-IDENTITY
macro of each MIB or PIB Module in the RFC-to-be.
<P>
The copyright statement to be added for a MIB module is as defined in Section
6.d of
the <a href="http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/IETF-Trust-License-Policy-20091228.htm">Trust

Normative References to RFC 2119
</H3></a>

Some standards-track documents use certain capitalized words ("MUST",
"SHOULD", etc.) to specify precise requirement-levels for technical
points.  RFC 2119 (BCP 14) [BCP14] defines a default interpretation of
these capitalized words in IETF documents.  If this interpretation
is used, RFC 2119 must be cited (as specified in RFC 2119) and
included as a normative reference.  Otherwise, the correct interpretation
must be specified in the document.

<blockquote>
    Avoid abuse of requirement-level words.  They are intended to
    provide guidance to implementors about specific technical features,
    generally governed by considerations of interoperability.  RFC 2119
    says, "Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used
    with care and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used
    where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit
    behavior which has potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting
    retransmissions).  For example, they must not be used to try to
    impose a particular method on implementors where the method is not
    required for interoperability."  To simply specify a necessary
    logical relationship; the normal lower-case words should be used.
    On the other hand, if the capitalized words are used in a document,
    they must be used consistently throughout the document.

Abbreviations
</H3></a>
The RFC document series, covering computer communication in general and
the Internet in particular, is generally deeply technical.  This
results in the very extensive use of abbreviations for technical
terms.  There is a tendency for RFC authors to assume a particular
sub-area's terminology and to therefore leave many abbreviations
undefined, "because everyone knows what that means".  Lack of clarity
and sometimes actual confusion of terminology may arise as a result.
To preserve the precision and clarity of the RFC documents, the RFC
Editor's policy is as follows.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the body of an RFC, <b>all</b> abbreviations
must be expanded when they first appear.  The only exceptions
are a few abbreviations that are so firmly extablished in
modern computer communication and in IETF usage that their use is very
unlikely to cause uncertainty or ambiguity.   These include:
	TCP, UDP,
	IP, IPv4, IPv6,
	DNS,
	HTTP,
	URL,
	IETF, IRTF, IESG, IAB,
	OSI,
	X.25, X.400, X.500.
<P>
<LI>
When abbreviations are thus expanded, the abbreviation
in parentheses should follow the expansion; for example:
<P>
<blockquote>
		"This memo proposes a modification to the Terribly
		Redundant Internet Protocol Encapsulation (TRIPE)
		protocol ..."
</blockquote>
<P>
<P>
<LI>The same rule applies separately to the Abstract.
Thus, an abbreviation that occurs in both the
Abstract and the body of an RFC must be expanded
in both places.
<P>
<LI>The same general principle applies to the title of the
RFC, although some latitude will be given to keep
titles from excessive length or complexity.

Choosing Titles
</H3></a>
<P>
Choosing a good title for an RFC can be a challenge.  A
good title should fairly represent the scope and purpose of the
document without being either too general or too specific.
<P>
Abbreviations (e.g., acronyms) in a title (as well as the Abstract and
the body) must generally be expanded when first encountered.  The
exception is abbreviations that are so common that every participant in
the IETF can be expected to recognize them immediately; examples
include (but are not limited to) TCP, IP, SNMP, and FTP.
<P>
It may be helpful to follow the expansion with the parenthesized
acronym.

Author Responsibility

<P>
The RFC Editor will hold all the people listed on the front page
equally responsible for the final form and content of the published

require signoff from all listed authors.
There will be no "honorary" authors.

<H3>
Author Overload
</H3></a>
<P>
The IESG and IETF have ratified a policy of limiting the number of
authors listed in the first page header of an RFC.
Objections to huge author lists are both practical and ideological.
The practical issues have to do with the long-existing RFC formatting
conventions that do not comfortably handle large author lists.
Ideological objections stem from the Internet community's tradition of
individual rather than corporate action and responsibility.  Some might
see a list of 17 authors on one RFC as motivated by a desire for
corporate name-dropping, which would be inappropriate in the IETF/RFC
context.  If there is a desire to demonstrate how many companies are
interested in this spec, a simple acknowledgment section can accomplish
the same thing, without Author Overload.
<P>
The Internet community's conventions for RFC authors are one of the
distinctive features of the IETF culture.  Most standards bodies
publish anonymous standards, whereas we attach the names of real
people, who get both credit and blame, to our specifications.  (This is
probably a result of the historical beginnings of the IETF in the
academic research community.)  The person(s) who actually write a
document take responsiblity for it, even though there may be a large
working group of several hundred people who potentially contributed to
it.  When there are a number of significant contributors, there is
usually a single person tasked with integrating the results into a
single document; that person may be listed as "Editor", with
acknowledgments for the other contributors.  Independent submissions
presumably did not originate in an IETF working group, but the same
conventions should apply to any informal industry group acting outside
the IETF, when the resulting spec is published as an RFC.
<P>
The specific policy is as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<li>
A small set of author names, with affiliations, may appear on the front
page header.  These should be the lead author(s) who are most
responsible for the actual text.  When there are many contributors, the
best choice will be to list the person or (few) persons who acted as
document editor(s) (e.g.,"Tom Smith, Editor").
<P>
There is no rigid limit on the size of this set, but there is likely to
be a discussion if the set exceeds five authors, in which case the
right answer is probably to list one editor.
<P>
<li>
An RFC may include a Contributors section, listing those contributors
who deserve significant credit for the document contents.  The
Contributors section is intended to provide a level of
recognition greater than an acknowledgment and nearly equal to listing
on the front page.  The choice of either, both, or none of Contributor
and Acknowledgment sections in a particular RFC depends upon the
circumstance.
<P>
<LI>
The body of an RFC may include an Acknowledgements section, in addition
to or instead of a Contributors section.  An Acknowledgments section
may be lengthy, and it may explain scope and nature of contributions.
It may also specify affiliations.
<P>
<LI>
The Author's Address section at the end of the RFC must include the
authors listed in the front page header.  The purpose of this section
is to (1) unambiguously define author/contributor identity (e.g., the
John Smith who works for FooBar Systems) and to (2) provide contact
information for future readers who have questions or comments.
<P>
At the discretion of the author(s), contact addresses may also be
included in the Contributors section for those contributors whose
knowledge makes them useful future contacts for information about the
RFC.
<P>
<LI>
The RFC Editor may grant exceptions to these guidelines upon specific
IESG request or in other exceptional circumstances.
</OL>
<P>
<A href="#policy.top"><IMG src="IMAGES2/bluecircle.gif">Go to Top.</A>
<P>
<A Name="policy.abstract">
<H3>
Abstract Section
</H3>
<P>

Every RFC must have an Abstract section following the Title of the
document.  An Abstract will typically be 5-10 lines.  An Abstract of
more than 20 lines is generally not acceptable.
<P>
The Abstract section should provide a concise and comprehensive
overview of the purpose and contents of the entire document, to give a
technically knowledgeable reader a general overview of the function of
the document.  In addition to its function in the RFC itself, the
Abstract section text will appear in publication announcements and in
the online index of RFCs.
<P>
Composing a useful Abstract generally requires thought and care.
Usually an Abstract should begin with a phrase like "This memo ..." or
"This document ...".  A satisfactory abstract can often be constructed
in part from material within the Introduction section, but a good
abstract will be shorter, less detailed, and perhaps broader in scope
than the Introduction.  Simply copying and pasting the first few
paragraphs of the Introduction is tempting, but it may result in an
Abstract that is both incomplete and redundant.  Note also that an
Abstract is not a substitute for an Introduction; the RFC should be
self-contained as if there were no Abstract section.
<P>
An Abstract should be complete in itself; it should not contain
citations unless they are completely defined within the Abstract.
Abbreviations appearing in the Abstract should generally be expanded in
parentheses.  There is a small set of reasonable exceptions to this
rule (see guidelines on abbreviations, above.)

<H3>
Table of Contents
</H3>
<P>

      A Table of Contents (TOC) section is required in RFCs longer than
      30 pages and recommended for an RFC longer than 15 pages.
<P>
      A TOC must be positioned after the Abstract and before the
      Introduction section (i.e., after the "boiler plate" and before the
      body of the RFC.)
<P>
      The TOC itself should not be too long or detailed, or it loses
      value.  For example, if many successive TOC entries point to the
      same pages of the memo, the TOC probably needs to be coarser.

      No specific format is required, but the following example illustrates a useful format:

<P>
      Each RFC should have an Introduction section that (among other
      things) explains the motivation for the RFC and (if appropriate)
      describes the applicability of the document, e.g., whether it
      specifies a protocol, provides a discussion of some problem, is
      simply of interest to the Internet community, or provides a status
      report on some activity.

The use of URLs in RFCs is discouraged,

the most stable reference available.  References to long-lived files

References Section

<P>
      Nearly all RFCs contain citations to other documents, and these
      are listed in a References section near the end of the RFC.
      There are many styles for references, and the RFCs have one of
      their own; there is not, however, a standard format for citations.
<P>
      Please follow the reference style used in recent
      RFCs.  For protocols that have been assigned STD numbers, the STD
      number must be included in the reference.
<P>
         Within an RFC, references to other documents fall into two
         general categories: "normative" and "informative".  Normative
         references specify documents that must be read to understand or
         implement the technology in the new RFC, or whose technology
         must be present for the technology in the new RFC to work.  An
         informative reference is not normative; rather, it only
         provides additional information.  For example, an informative
         reference might provide background or historical information.
         Informative references are not required to implement the
         technology in the RFC.

Address Munging in Contact Information

<P>
The practice of address munging (i.e., altering an email address to make it
less readable to bots and web crawlers to avoid spam) is not appropriate in an
archival document series.  Author contact information is provided so that
readers can easily contact the author with questions and/or comments.  The
practice of address munging makes it more difficult to contact the authors of a
