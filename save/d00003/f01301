       or support without making a useful or adequate return
</blockquote>

<p>
The parasite infests its host.
<p>

It starts its life as a small, barely noticeable bundle of cells, but
its effects are already being felt.  Biochemical changes affect the
host's body;  resources are diverted to the parasite as it uses its
insidious influence to make the host provide it with an ideal environment
for its growth.
<p>

And that growth occurs rapidly.  Within hours it has doubled in size, 
<img src="photos/crunch/mum_dad_small.jpg" align=right border=2 alt="[exhausted parents...]"> then it doubles again -- and again.  Exponential growth can't continue
forever, but while it does the parasite consumes ever-larger amounts
of its host's energy and food resources.
<p>

As it grows it also causes further biochemical changes.  The host becomes
sick, with some days beginning with uncontrollable vomiting.  Skin
rashes, hot flushes and nausea plague the host.  Hormonal changes make
her crave bizarre food combinations that ordinary, uninfested humans would
never think of eating.
<p>

Many of these symptoms continue for months.  Other symptoms set-in too:
Muscle soreness and joint pain, for example.  Some effects are
permanent, too -- Others have the potential to act as triggers for 
conditions which may adversely affect the host's later life, many years
after she has overcome her parasitic infestation.
<p>

Some of the hormonal changes it triggers have more subtle effects.  A normal
human reaction to a parasite is to attempt to expel it, kill it, destroy
it.  However, psychological changes triggered by hormone release stimulated
by this one make her want to actually *care* for it.  Trained medical staff
who might attempt to cure her suffering by poisoning or removing the
parasite are greeted with violent hostility, a situation unique in the 
range of human experiences:  A disease that makes you want to keep it, 
rather than cure it!
<p>

Cognitive dissonance sets in:  One moment she'll be complaining about
physiological changes which have made her life almost intolerably difficult,
describing the aches and pains, sickness, wierd itches and loss of
functionality; The next moment she'll be extolling the virtues of these
"interesting" new experiences.  If you believe her descriptions of things,
it's actually *nice* to feel sick, sore, hungry and exhausted.
<p>

Growth continues.  The host must consume ever larger quantities of
food -- In return she gets ever-smaller amounts of benefit from it, 
as the parasite steals the food from her body.  Its growth makes her body
bulge outwardly, stretching her skin tight and paper-thin.  As the 
animal within her gets stronger it kicks and punches at the inside of
her body, further stretching her flesh, its violence disturbing her sleep
and distracting her from normal human activities.  She tells everyone
who will listen that it's a "unique" experience that she's enjoying --
But we don't believe her, do we?  We know she's just echoing something
akin to a bizarre post-hypnotic suggestion placed in her mind by the
chemical triggers implanted by the parasite.
<p>

<img alt="[a picture of a somewhat blotchy baby]" border=2 align="right" src="photos/crunch/sebastian.jpg">Finally, after many months of monotonically-increasing suffering, the
parasite enters the next phase of its life-cycle:  It is finished with
this host, and must now leave to reproduce, to infect other humans with
its offspring.  In a scene reminiscent of some of the more nauseating
parts of "Alien," it bursts forth from her tired and tattered body,
while she, grateful to finally be rid of it, pushes it out with all her
remaining reserves of strength.
<p>

Sobbing, exhausted, wracked with pain, high on endorphins, she gazes
down at the parasite that has infested her for nearly a year:  Except
we can't call it a parasite anymore, at least, not until it's a teenager.
<p>

His name is "Sebastian."
<p>

Sebastian was born at 9:26pm on Tuesday June 16th after a six hour
labour.  It was a water birth, attended by a midwife (who carried
out her duties knowledgably and efficiently), Crispin (who was a
bit confused and helpless), and, of course, Kirsten.
<p>

Kirsten was in the loungeroom of the house she shares with Crispin,
in a bathtub filled with warm water.  Sebastian took his first breath
a few moments after leaving the womb when his face broke the surface
of the water.  He didn't cry.  
<p>

Crispin reports:  "I didn't know if he was alright when he didn't cry.
I kept telling myself, `The midwife looks relaxed, so it must be ok.
The midwife looks relaxed, so it must be ok.'"  He felt a bit out of
it and wasn't sure what he was doing, so the umbilical cord wasn't
cut for many minutes -- The midwife thought he was going to do it, he
thought the opposite.
<p>

Sebastian was lifted up to have his gender confirmed:  With this crushing
first onslaught of society's sexual stereotypes his calm composure broke and
he cried for the first time.
<p>

He seems to take after his father:  Not only does he share some aspects
of physical appearance, but he seems to be happiest when he's sucking
one of someone else's body parts in his mouth, and he doesn't much care
<img alt="[a picture of dad with his new son]" align="left" src="photos/crunch/dad_small.jpg" border=2>about the gender of the body part's owner, which part he's sucking, or
whether he's met the body part's owner before.  I think he's going to
grow up to be a tenor.
<p>

He would have to be the quietest baby I've ever seen.  He whinges a 
bit when he needs his nappy changed, but other than that the only thing
you hear from him is contented gurgles.  Some babies cry when they're 
hungry, cold, hot, sick, or whatever;  Sebastian just grunts a bit and
uses facial expression to convey the exact meaning of the grunt.  Crispin
and Kirsten have been progressively narrowing down the meaning of 
each expression by trial and error, so he's coming to understand that
his needs can be met without the squalling and screaming some babies 
inflict on their parents.  My visit lasted six hours and he didn't cry
once throughout that time;  Crispin indicates that that's in no way unusual.
<p>

Consequently, both parents are getting reasonable amounts of sleep, 
something that's almost unheard of among new parents.  Sebastian sleeps
in his parents bed, so they are almost at the point where they can
assist him with breastfeeding without waking fully.  Experience relayed
to them by other parents indicates that those skills will only improve,
to the point where they'll be able to feed him at night without noticing
what's happening, possibly without even remembering they've done it 
when they wake up in the morning.
<p>

I was in Perth from Saturday 20th June 'til Friday 26th June.  I visited
<img align=right border=2 src="photos/crunch/perth_small.jpg" alt="[a picture of Perth's Swan River]">Crispin and Kirsten on the Saturday, when Sebastian was four days old.
They weren't calling him Sebastian then, mind you:  He was still "Wiggle,"
because they hadn't settled on a name.  Crispin asked me what I thought
of "Sebastian Nicholas" mid-way through the afternoon, and I get the
feeling the baby would have ended up with a different name if I raised
an objection to it;  I feel quite honoured to have been asked for input
on such an important matter.
<p>

While in Perth I also visited an ex-flatmate of Crispin from when he first
moved to WA.  Mike said, "Yeah!  When I first heard that Crispin was going
to be a father the first thing I thought was, `Unbelievable.  He's with
a *girl!*'"  And it's true:  The 1998 Crispin is a far cry from the Crunch
we knew when he lived in Adelaide.  Gone are the heady days of TDI,
with their implications of sexual promiscuity, "relaxed" preferences,
devil-may-care irresponsibility, drunken orgies, that silly squashed-up
grinning expression he wears on his face when he's high, and all-night
<img align=left src="photos/crunch/crunch2.jpg" alt="[Hasn't he changed?]" border=2>partying.  Crispin in 1998 is monogomous.  He truly cares about life
insurance and superannuation.  He hands out business cards, and lusts
after job titles which include the word "Manager." He thinks about
five-year-plans.  He hasn't worn a sequined jacket to work since 1995. 
He uses Microsoft products. An ignorant observer could be forgiven for
thinking his spirit had been broken, but those who know him better
understand that it has merely been turned to new directions.
<p>

While observing him picking up a folded nappy from his bedroom floor and
placing it in a cupboard:  
<p>
<blockquote>
  "Having a baby really changes things.  Soon I'll even be keeping
  my room tidy."<br>
<i>    [ pause, while he observes me casting my eyes about the pristene room ]<br></i>
  "This is the third time I've cleaned this room in the last 24 hours.
  <b>Shit!</B>"
</blockquote>
The concept of Crispin changing a dirty nappy is difficult to visualize,
and must be seen to be believed.
<p>

Of course, Sebastian won't get a conservative upbringing, no matter how
down-to-earth his father has recently become:  There are hoards of
PUCSters and FUCSters who will *literally* drag Crispin over the coals
at the slightest hint of hypocrisy.  We're all committed to making sure
that Sebastian repeats his father's mistakes if he wants to -- And enjoys
every minute of it.  Kirsten seems to count herself among this group of
concerned onlookers too.
<p>

The signs at present are that there's no chance of Sebastian having a
boring childhood anyway:  His life has been unconventional from the 
start.  From the water birth to the fact that his parents spent so much
time fussing over him that he wasn't actually named until four days after
he was born, Crispin and Kirsten seem committed to enriching his life at
the expense of the conventions that society would otherwise wish to impose.  
<p>

To be truthful, I don't think I've ever seen a pair of parents more
committed to that ideal.  The concept of choristers having children seems
scary at first, especially when one considers that one of the choristers
involved in Crispin Harris.  As the saga unfolds, however, I find myself
envious of their new son, because I know that he'll receive care, 
understanding and opportunities enjoyed by very few people.
