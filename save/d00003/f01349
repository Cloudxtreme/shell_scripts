an earth that's slowing down would mean that midnight would eventually fall in
the middle of the day.  As this is probably unacceptable, some extra seconds
can be added or removed inside the <ACRONYM

the earth's rotation, which is not at all.  Therefore you can't easily make
calculations for dates in the future using <ACRONYM
