          <p><img src="http://www.ngotld.org/files/newsletter/icanndraw.jpg" align="right" />In an effort to fairly determine how to process 1,900 new top-level domain applications, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the global technical coordinator of the domain name system, held a drawing on December 17, 2012.  Public Interest Registry (PIR) participated in this event, drawing the number 958 for .NGO and 810 for .ONG.  These numbers represent the order in which the applications for .NGO and .ONG will be evaluated from the pool of 1,900 applications. At this point, given that we drew numbers that fall in the middle of the order, it is our best estimate that .NGO and .ONG will launch early to mid-2014.</p>
          <p>            Once <a href="http://www.ngotld.org/">.NGO and .ONG</a> pass the initial evaluation without contention or objection, PIR will be granted the option to immediately sign the standard ICANN registry contract.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, PIR is seeking to help NGOs throughout the world get on the Internet and help them manage their online presence to promote awareness for their cause(s) and uplift their communities. This is a very exciting time for PIR as we continue to move forward with the launch process of .NGO and .ONG. </p>
          <p>We will keep you updated on our progress and launch plans as we learn more about the timing of the application evaluation process.          </p>

          <h2>Continued Dialogs with NGOs</h2>
          <p><img src="http://www.ngotld.org/files/newsletter/manthan2012.jpg" align="right"/>PIR is continuing its outreach efforts to the NGO community by participating in various global events that are directly focused on the nonprofit sector.  Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2012 PIR sponsored the Independent Sector’s Game Changers Conference in San Francisco and the Manthan Awards in New Delhi.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent Sector Game Changers</strong> – This conference took place over three days and featured speakers known for boldly taking the lead on innovating, financing and creatively collaborating for greater effectiveness and impact on the NGO sector. </li>
            <li> <strong>Manthan Awards</strong> - This is an annual event recognizing exceptional digital content creation in South Asia by NGOs.  The highlight of this year’s event was the launch of PIR’s inaugural eNGO award, which recognizes outstanding websites among 700 local NGOs. </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Global Giving Online Shows Growth<img src="http://www.ngotld.org/files/newsletter/checkwriting.jpg" align="right" /></h2>
<p>One of the requirements for successfully operating a NGO is to raise sufficient funding to support your mission. Currently, there is limited global reporting to accurately measure statistics for online giving outside of the U.S.; however, within the United States, we do know that about eight percent of all fundraising is now done online (Source: Blackbaud). This has grown tremendously over the past decade. In fact, every sector analyzed in the Blackbaud 2011 Online Giving Report 2011 has seen double-digit growth since 2009.</p>
<p>According to The Chronicle of Philanthropy, the nonprofits that raise the most online come from the social service, international, and health sectors that engage in disaster relief or peer-to-peer event fundraising. In comparison, nonprofits in the education, medical, and arts sectors raise smaller amounts of money online for their given causes (Source: Blackbaud). </p>
