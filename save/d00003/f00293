          <p><img src="http://www.ngotld.org/files/newsletter/eoi_pic.jpg" width="300" height="220" align="right" />The launch of .NGO and .ONG is less than a year away; but your preparation and planning behind registering these domain names should start now. </p>
          <p>            Sending an Expression of Interest (EOI) is quick, simple and free. More importantly, it is one of the smartest things you can do to ensure a successful registration. When .NGO/.ONG becomes available, there will be rules and guidelines, as well as a launch sequence, which dictates who (trademark owners, early adopters, and the general public, etc.) can register, and when. The benefits of submitting an EOI include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Email updates on developing information regarding all launch processes by Public Interest Registry, the authoritative operator of the .NGO/.ONG domain extension.</li>
            <li> An alert service containing relevant and important data pertaining to the registration process of .NGO/.ONG, such as how to register for the Trademark Clearinghouse and requirements for participation in early registration.</li>
            <li> Exclusive news on any offers from authorized companies handling the registration of .NGO/.ONG at launch time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We strongly encourage you to submit your expression of interest to stay on top of all the important guidelines, tips, and dates for the launch of .NGO/.ONG.          </p>
          <p>To submit an Expression of Interest, please visit: <a href="http://www.ngotld.org">www.ngotld.org</a></p>

          <h2>Are You a Trademark Holder? What You Need to Know About ICANN's Trademark Clearinghouse</h2>
          <p><img src="http://www.ngotld.org/files/newsletter/tmch_check.jpg" width="200" height="139" align="right" />As the Internet prepares to launch over 1,400 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) starting in Q2 2013, there is the possibility and likelihood of competing claims over domains and the need for a centralized database for registered trademarks. On March 26, 2013, ICANN announced the launch of the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH), to help protect trademark rights’ owners as the Internet landscape transforms to enable brand owners to actively participate in the Sunrise (first) phase when .NGO/.ONG domain(s) are launched.</p>
          <p> All registries will be using this centralized database when launching their new TLDs. TMCH will be very important to you because its services will ultimately provide dual protection for your trademark registration. The TMCH’s Sunrise Service will enable trademark holders to register the domain name that corresponds with their trademark for a limited registration period; it is the only way to register new domain names ahead of the public launch. Additionally, its Trademark Claims Service will notify trademark holders and domain name registrants of potential infringement concerns for a period of 60 days immediately after the Sunrise phase, (i.e. when a registrant applies for a domain name that has already been declared a trademark by a trademark holder in the TMCH registry).</p>
          <p>The costs associated with placing a trademark in the TMCH are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$145 for 1 year</strong></li>
            <li> <strong>$435 for 3 years</strong></li>
            <li><strong> $725 for 5 years.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Up to $150 per year for the renewal of an expiring TMCH registration </strong></li>
          </ul>
<p>  Public Interest Registry will continue to provide updated information as we grow closer to the Sunrise phase of .NGO/.ONG. Visit the <a href="http://trademark-clearinghouse.com/">Trademark Clearinghouse</a> website for complete details.</p>

          <h2>Fundraising For Your NGO</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.ngotld.org/files/newsletter/sm_donate2012.jpg" width="220" height="164" align="right" />The digital world is an ever-growing entity that connects and enables communication amongst 2.4 billion Internet users. This creates a very opportune platform  for nonprofits and NGOs to build a presence, give a voice to various causes, and fundraise online.</p>
<p>According to the eNonprofit Benchmarks Study on digital fundraising, conducted by M+R Strategic Services and <a href="http://www.nten.org/">Nonprofit Technology Network</a> (NTEN), total online revenue for nonprofits increased by <strong>21%</strong> in 2012. One-third of this revenue was driven by email initiatives, while the remaining two-thirds were raised through alternative sources - unsolicited web giving, peer referrals, and social media. As a nonprofit or NGO, it would benefit you and your organization to have online presence in order to: drive traffic to your optimized website, have a call to action or carry out campaign efforts, and engage with donors and other online supporters. </p>
<p>As technology continues to develop, so does the need for a successful digital strategy that will help to yield growth in fundraising dollars. It is imperative for nonprofits and NGOs to learn how to leverage technology and communication through integrated marketing initiatives.</p>
<p>According to MDG Advertising, raising money for causes through social media has more than doubled in the last 5 years – largely in part because of: shared content; the viral nature of online movements, events, and news; crowd funding platforms, integration across social networks; and social endorsements and trends. Ultimately, nonprofits and NGOs must adapt as communication channels continue to transform.</p>
