<h1>Adelaide Free Speech Rally</h1>
<h3><i>Mark Newton, May 30 1999</i></h3>
<blockquote><i>

Of all the tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exorcised
for the good of it's victims may be the most oppressive.
It may be better to live under the robber barons
then under omnipotent moral busybodies.
The robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep,
his cupidity may at some point be satiated,
but those who torment us for our own good will, torment us without end,
for they will do so with the approval of their own conscience.
<p>
</i>
   C.S. Lewis

This speech was ad-libbed (I didn't know I was speaking at all until ten
minutes before the event).  I've tried to be accurate, but may have 
substituted the odd bit I would have <i>liked</i> to have said, rather 
than what I actually said -- The human mind works that way sometimes :-)
<p>
Feel free to <a href="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">email</a> me if 
you think I've grossly misrepresented myself, anyway.
<p>
I've written more on this issue, including a <a href="senate">submission</a> to the 
Senate Select Committee on Information Technology.

Good afternoon to you all, and thank you for coming.
<p>
My name is Mark Newton, and I've been working in the Internet industry
for many years.  Like virtually everyone else in the industry, I'm now
having serious doubts about my long-term ability to carry out my career 
of choice in this country.
<p>
I was reading a book last night by Geoffrey Robertson, and in this book
he talked briefly about the history of "Lady Chatterley's Lover" by 
D. H. Lawrence.  This book, now considered a classic of literature and
taught in high-school English classes, was banned in the UK and Australia
during the 1960's as an obscene publication.  
<p>
Geoffrey Robertson described the lawsuit which finally, after many years,
forced the ban to be lifted in England.  However, in Australia, Robert 
Menzies, the man it is said that John Howard desperately wishes to emulate,
upheld the ban!
<p>
Why did he do this?  The answer was simple:  Mr. Menzies said, <i>"... it's
not the kind of book I'd want my wife reading."</i>  It was that simple.
<i>It's not the kind of book I'd want my wife reading.</i>
<p>
The Australian Customs Service diligently protected Robert Menzies' wife,
prosecuting anyone who dared to attempt to import this horribly obscene
publication into Australia.  Not only did Mr. Menzies deny the book to his
wife, he made the decision to ban it for everyone else too.
<p>
Now we come to 1999.  John Howard gave an interview on Adelaide's 5AN 
on Thursday this week.  When asked about Internet censorship, he said
that there was <i>a lot of stuff on the Internet he didn't think his
children should see</I>.  It's Menzies all over again, isn't it?
<p>
In the lead up to this legislation, Mr. Howard and Senator Alston have
been talking up a storm about the technical feasiblity of "content filtering,"
a technical term for what we know of as "censorship".  One of the ways that
content filtering can apparently be carried out is by means of filtering
packages, or "censorware."  One of the censorware software packages named
by Mr. Alston during the woefully short public debate on this issue is
the somewhat ironically named product known as <a href="http://www.censorware.net/reports/utah">SmartFilter</a>.
<p>
SmartFilter has been examined at some length, and like <i>every other 
censorware package yet evaluated,</I> it doesn't stand up to its own 
advertising.  Despite claims that the secret black-list it uses is reviewed
by humans, it blocks all kinds of things which no human would ever say 
were unsuitable for children, such as the US Declaration of Independence,
the complete works of William Shakespere, and much, much more.  Perhaps
SmartFilter isn't all that smart after all.
<p>
One of the sites incorrectly blocked by SmartFilter is the website of 
something known as <a href="http://wiretap.spies.com">Project Gutenberg</a>.
This project has undertaken the monumental task of transcribing classics
of literature into electronic form so that they can be made available for
free to all on the Internet.
<p>
This site has been blocked by SmartFilter under the category of "Criminal Skills".
Nobody knows why an online library would be blocked as "Criminal Skills",
that's just a fact of life when you're talking about censorware.  It is 
simply technologically impossible for censorware to work in the way its 
manufacturers claim it works, due to the size of the internet and the stupidity
of computers.
<p>
Ironically enough, one of the books in the immense unseen library of 
articles which are banned by 
SmartFilter is <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> by D. H. Lawrence, the same
book that was banned by Robert Menzies.
<p>
We've come full circle:  Welcome back to the 1950s.  This is 21st century
morality, John Howard style, or a glimpse of the future though Richard 
Alston's eyes. 
<p>
So I ask you all, <i>is this the kind of world you want to leave behind for
your children?</i>
<p>
