<title>OpenBSD weaknesses</title>

<p>Although OpenBSD is my favourite operating system, I'm not claiming it's perfect. It certainly has its shortcomings. I've found the following :
<ul>
<li>no IPv6 RPC (for NFS mounts over IPv6 - NetBSD has working code)
<li><s>upgrading ports/packages can be a PITA (FreeBSD's portupgrade or Debian's apt are far from perfect, but better then what is available in OpenBSD)</s>
<li>inconsequent handling of 0/32 routing/addressing
<li>no scrub support for IPv6 in PF
<li><s>no IPv6 support for bgpd (IPv6 is supported as a transport now)</s>
<li>no cardbus(4) and/or pcmcia(4) support on OpenBSD/alpha
</ul>
<p>As I am in no way capable of fixing these issues, I'll have to either wait for someone else to fix them or learn how to fix them myself. In the mean time I'm sponsoring the OpenBSD developers as much as I can, maybe they'll pick up on these issues.
<br>
<p>Since I wrote this, several enhancements have gone into OpenBSD. The OpenBGPD now does support IPv6. Upgrading ports and packages has seen immense improvements. It is not completely done yet, but it is now so good that it works for most cases.
