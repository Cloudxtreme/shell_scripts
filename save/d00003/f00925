  <li> <h3>Natkeep</h3> <p>

  natkeep is written by Matthew Fredette &lt;fredette@mit.edu&gt;.</p><p>

  natkeep monitors the network, watching for connections between AFS
  clients and servers, and periodically transmits fake packets
  matching those connections.  These fake packets have a junk one-byte
  UDP payload, but have a user-specified TTL that is supposed to be
  just enough to get the packet through the NAT, without reaching the
  AFS servers.</p><p>
