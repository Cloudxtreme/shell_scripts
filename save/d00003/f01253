You find the RPM's you need for running 
<a href="ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/arla/distributions/SuSE-9.1/">
arla on Suse 9.1 here</a> <BR>
Use the lastest of the arla RPMs. If your kernel
is not supported by the RPM, you can try to build
your own RPM from the SRPM.

<h4> Known Issues </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  You will also need to install the "heimdal" and "heimdal-lib" packages from SuSE.
  The easiest way is to search for "heimdal" in YaST and install all of them.
  <li>
  Arla does not work stabely when the cache partition resides on a
  filesystem other than ext2 or ext3. As the default file system type
  is reiserfs, you will probably need to create a new partition with 
  ext2 or ext3.
  The arla start script checks that your cache partiton mounted at 
  <tt>/var/cache/arla</tt>
  is of the correct type. If you know what you are doing, and you
  want to change that, edit the startup script to fit your needs.
  <li>
  The SuSE folks did something new when they made the 2.6.5 kernels. You can't
  build modules against these "as usual" so if you have these kernels installed
  and build RPMs from the SRPM a new <tt>/lib/modules/VERSION/build.arla/</tt> 
  directory will be made from your <tt>/lib/modules/VERSION/source/</tt> and
  <tt>/lib/modules/VERSION/build/</tt> directories. You may want to clean
  up that directory yourself when you are done.
</ul>


<h3>Older versions of SuSE</h3>

There are no RPM's for those releases, try the SRPM or build from the source.
The spec file in the SRPM tries to build a nnpfs kernel module for every
kernel that has kernel source installed.
