<h3>New Features for NextMail: Google Independence &amp; DotNetNuke
Support</h3>

Recently we had an interesting use case for NextMail defined for us by one
of the schools in our community. Can NextMail be used to provide account
maintenance and Single SignOn benefits for a school's parents for whom a
GMail account will not be required? Oh and by the way we want the parent
portal to be a website developed in DotNetNuke(DNN) that works in
conjunction with Moodle.  This use case required two new features for
NextMail: Independence from Google and support for DNN.
<br />
<br />

<h4>Google Independence</h4>

As NextMail started out in life as a way of enhancing and simplifying the
webmail offerings of Google, it was a major effort to separate NextMail's
core code base from them. Of course we have retained full support for GMail
keeping all of the enhancements and administrative aids that we have
introduced over the past 3 years.

<br /><br />

Separating NextMail from GMail delivers very real pluses to NextMail as it
now means that we provide a complete stand alone SAML Identity Provider
service to you - our client schools. In addition it means that your schools
can assemble flexible solutions on a mix-n-match basis utilising all of the
SAML based web services that are now available.
<br />
<br />

<h4>DNN Support</h4>

By design, NextMail has been built from the ground up to be flexible and
compliant with open published standards. So when we were asked to provide
support for DNN we were brimming with confidence that we would be able to
comply and set out on our search for an off the shelf DNN solution.

<br /><br />
Little did we know that our search would take us half way around the world
to the University of Florida. UF's development staff had just released a DNN
module enabling support for Shibboleth SignOn authentication - a protocol
with which our code was compatible. We made contact with the UF developers
and went to work, customising, debugging, testing, tweaking and adjusting. 

<br /><br />
After 3 weeks, numerous email exchanges, upgraded modules, several webex
sessions and late nights on both sides of the world we successfully married
an out of the box DNN install to NextMail's SSO capabilities - just in time
for the DNN World Conference in Florida in October!  This combination of new
capabilities further enhances your school's ability to build and deliver
innovative solutions for your use case with NextMail.

<h3>Studentnet: Highly Commended at the 2012 ANZIA Awards</h3>

At a Gala Presentation Dinner held in Old Parliament House Canberra on
October 10, 2012, the Australia and New Zealand Internet Awards winners were
announced. We are proud to announce that Studentnet received a <a
href="http://internetawards.org.au/index.php/winners/2012winners">High
Commendation at the 2012 ANZIA Awards.</a>
<br />
<br />

   Quoting from the 2012 ANZIA winners announcement:
<br />

"Studentnet specialises in Internet services to Australian schools and has
created an IPv6 collaborative network for schools based on delivering IPv6
networking infrastructure into the school environment.  The judges felt it
was quite encouraging to learn that students could enable IPv6 access in
their campus networks on World IPv6 Day in 2011 and the World IPv6 Launch in
2012.
The judges agreed that Studentnet has been a pioneer in the use of IPv6
technology for several years and should be rewarded for its efforts to
educate 'next generation' end users with new IP protocol and also Internet
security issues."

<br />
<br />

Studentnet is proud to have been Highly Commended at Australia and New
Zealand's most prestigious Internet awards event.  We look forward to
continuing our program of innovation so that we can deliver better quality
technical solutions at lower cost to the school education community.

<br /> <br />
