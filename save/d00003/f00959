		            guests,<br>
		        Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
		      </font>
		        <p>It&#8217;s only a couple of weeks ago that I&#8217;ve got to know
		          the conference on SOI ASIA Project be held in Da Nang and I could
		          afford to be here today as I really wanted to attend it, for two
		          reasons: one reason is to meet the world-famous Prof. Murai and the
		          other is to get to know the project itself.</p>
		        <p>Actually, I already know that &#8220;SOI ASIA Project&#8221; deals
		          with an education system through Internet in Asian region.
		          And I also know that this project is initiated and led by Prof. Murai
		          of
		          Keio University. But I do not have detailed ideas on what is
		          executed by this system and how they are carried out.</p>
		        <p>Therefore, three days ago, before attending this conference, I visited
		          Institute of Information Technology in Hanoi and was briefed by Dr.
		          Le Hai Khoi, Dr. Luong Chi Mai and Dr. Tran Ba Thai, which impressed
		          me greatly.</p>
		        <p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br>
		          As Japanese ambassador to Viet Nam, I have been thinking days
		            and nights on how Japan should cooperate for economic development
		            of Viet Nam.</p>
		        <p>It is my conviction that the East Asian countries including China
		          are now struggling and competing with one another for its economic
		          development and even for its survival in an extremely fierce manner.
		          I used to name it as a &#8220;Grand Competition Era&#8221;.</p>
		        <p>How can Viet Nam, a less developed country even among ASEAN, not
		          only cope with this Grand Competition but survive and even excel
		          others ? It can never be possible with its cheap and skillful labour
		          only. Viet Nam must make full use of its advantages which I believe
		          lie in Vietnamese intellectual potential, among which is information
		          technology.</p>
		        <p>With this in mind, I&#8217;ve been thinking of how Japan can assist
		          information technology development of Viet Nam by way of ODA in both
		          hard and software.</p>
		        <p>It is my wish that in the near future Viet Nam be dubbed as &#8220;India
		          of East Asia&#8221; by being able to be a place of providing software
		          human resources to other Asian countries in the field of information
		          technology.</p>
		        <p>Now I have a fantastic idea under study with the help of Mr. Shozawa
		          of Asia SEED who is present here today. This idea is supposed to
		          serve mainly two objectives: one is to educate Vietnamese students
		          both in Japan and in Viet Nam in various new and advanced technologies
		          such as information technology and second is to upgrade Vietnamese
		          universities and institution&#8217;s level of researches in the same
		          field by way of a wide range of linkages between Japanese and Vietnamese
		          universities.</p>
		        <p>We would like to utilize Japanese ODA to implement the idea. I wonder
		          if SOI ASIA Project can be a good example or even a part of it.</p>
		        <p>In concluding, I would like to express all my appreciation to Prof.
		          Murai and all the participants to the conference, and hope that the
		          Da Nang meeting will be an important milestone for further cooperation
		          among the Asian countries. </p>
		        <p>Thank you.<br>
