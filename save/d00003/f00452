  <p class="title">ICANN Nominating Committee - Agreement to Adhere to the Code 
    of Ethics</p>
</div>
<p><b>1. Scope</b></p>
<blockquote> This Code of Ethics applies to and must be agreed to by: 
  	
  <blockquote> 1) any and all ICANN Nominating Committee (NomCom) members [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII</a>]<br>
    2) any and all ICANN staff members engaged in supporting the work of the Nominating 
    Committee, and <br>
    3) any and all outside consultants who may be retained by the Nominating Committee 
    to assist with any phase of its work. 
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>2. NomCom&#8217;s Objectives</b></p>
<blockquote> The following are the core objectives of the NomCom:
   <blockquote>
   1. Identify, recruit, and nominate the highest-quality nominees for the positions 
    NomCom is charged to fill;<br>
    2. Advance the core mission and values of ICANN [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I-1,2">Bylaws 
    Article I, Sections 1 and 2</a>];<br>
    3. Trust and respect all members of the NomCom;<br>
    4. Pursue diversity in geography, culture, skills, experience, and perspectives 
    from across the global Internet community;<br>
    5. Earn the trust and respect of the Internet community by acting with fairness 
    and integrity, and by providing transparency of objectives, criteria, procedures, 
    and mechanisms for receiving input, while respecting candidates&#8217; privacy 
    and maintaining the confidentiality that is necessary to assure open and frank 
    communications within NomCom;<br>
    6. Adhere to the ICANN Bylaws. 
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>3. NomCom&#8217;s Role</b></p>  
  <blockquote>
  NomCom is responsible for the selection of portions of the members of the ICANN 
  Board of Directors, GNSO Council, Interim ALAC, and ccNSO Council, filling these 
  leadership positions in a way that complements the selections made for such 
  positions by the Supporting Organizations and Interim ALAC.</b></p>
<p>The central rationale for using a nominating committee to select a portion 
  of the ICANN leadership bodies is to balance those who can represent particular 
  areas of knowledge and interests with those who place the broad public interest 
  of the global Internet community ahead of any particular interests. NomCom&#8217;s 
  role is to select individuals of the highest integrity and capability who place 
  the broad public interest of the global Internet community ahead of any particular 
  interests, and who are nevertheless knowledgeable about ICANN&#8217;s mission 
  and environment. </p>
  <p>To achieve this broad public-interest orientation, the members of NomCom are 
    drawn from across the ICANN and global Internet communities. They act only 
    on behalf of the interests of the global Internet community within the scope 
    of the ICANN mission and the responsibilities assigned to NomCom by ICANN 
    Bylaws. They act as individuals and are not beholden to their appointing constituencies 
    as they work by consensus to derive the NomCom slates of Selected Nominees 
    for these leadership bodies.<br>
    <br>
    The NomCom functions independently from the ICANN Board, Supporting Organizations, 
    and Advisory Committees. The NomCom selections are final; no further approval 
    or ratification is needed.<br>
    <br>
    Together the NomCom and Supporting Organization selection pathways ensure 
    that ICANN benefits from functional, cultural, geographic diversity in its 
    policy development and decision-making as the Internet evolves.<br>
    <br>
    NomCom is responsible for the selection of all ICANN Directors except the 
    President and those selected by ICANN's Supporting Organizations, and for 
    such other selections as are set forth in the Bylaws. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VII-1">Bylaws 
    Article VII, Section 1</a>]<b> </b> </blockquote>
<p><b>Integrity and Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
<blockquote> NomCom members act only on behalf of the interests of the global 
  Internet community and within the scope of the ICANN mission and responsibilities 
  assigned to it by the ICANN Bylaws. The NomCom is designed to function independently 
  from the ICANN Board, the Supporting Organizations, and Advisory Committees.
  <p>NomCom members are expected to adhere to the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/coi/coi-policy-04mar99.htm">ICANN 
    Conflict of Interest Policy</a>. Each NomCom member must disclose promptly 
    to the Chair any financial or other relations that might affect (or might 
    reasonably be seen to affect) his/her performance on the Committee, including 
    any financial connections to any individual under consideration by the NomCom. 
    A subcommittee will be formed by the Chair to review disclosed conflicts or 
    potential conflicts and to determine how to handle them. NomCom members must 
    recuse themselves from participation in discussion and voting where such conflict 
    exists. </p>
  <p>NomCom members must not have any pre-existing commitments concerning the 
    nomination of any particular candidates or potential candidates.</p>
  <p>Each NomCom member is expected to pursue the stated objectives of the Committee, 
    to comply with the rules and procedures established by the Committee, and 
    to support the decisions the Committee makes.</p>
  <p>Each NomCom member is expected to do his/her best to find the highest-qualified 
    candidates for consideration by the NomCom, and to do his/her best to encourage 
    those individuals to serve.</p>
  <p>At no time shall any member of NomCom act in a way that would bring the Committee 
    into disrepute or undermine the integrity of the process by which the Committee 
    makes its selections.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Confidentiality and Privacy</b></p>
<blockquote> All NomCom members will safeguard all internal NomCom communications 
  and treat them as strictly private, confidential, and for the use of immediate 
  committee members and NomCom staff only, without exception. <br>
  <br>
  NomCom members will not disclose outside of the Committee any of the discussions 
  about the candidates. Further, NomCom members will not disclose outside of the 
  Committee the identities of candidates under consideration by NomCom, unless 
  NomCom as a whole has decided to do so and the explicit consent of the candidate(s) 
  in question has been obtained. </blockquote>
<p><b>Formal Statement of Commitment to the Code of Ethics</b></p>
<blockquote> I understand the core objectives of the NomCom and fully agree to 
  adhere to this Code of Ethics and the ICANN Conflicts of Interest Policy. Failure 
  to do so will constitute grounds for my immediate removal from the NomCom. I 
  fully agree to keep confidential all NomCom related discussions and to destroy 
  any and all NomCom communications, records and notes when not serving on the 
  NomCom. <br>
  <br>
  Please sign below as having read, understood and agreed to this Code of Ethics. 
</blockquote>
