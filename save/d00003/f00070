      <h4><a name="UNMODIFIEDCLIENT">Why do people have to
	use unmodified Tarsnap client code?</a></h4>
      <p>
	In designing Tarsnap, I had to make trade-offs at several places
	between making the client as efficient as possible and making the
	server efficient enough that I can run it cheaply.  There are places
	in the Tarsnap client code where it looks like "optimizations" could
	be made; but if people start making those changes then I'd need to
	detect this on the server and adjust the pricing formula so that
	those users pay extra to compensate for the increased load they're
	placing on the server... so it's much better just to say "don't do
	that".
      </p>
      <p>
	That said, if you have a great idea for improving the Tarsnap client
	code, I want to hear from you.  Ideas are great; patches are even
	better, of course.
	<a href="mailto:cperciva@tarsnap.com?subject=Tarsnap%20improvement">Send
	me an email</a>.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="PRIVACYLAW">Why do I reserve the right to provide
	information to law enforcement authorities?</a></h4>
      <p>
	Short answer: Because there are some situations where it would be
	reasonable, and I want to be able to apply my own judgement in
	determining when those situations are.
      </p>
      <p>
	Long answer: International law is painful, particularly where things
	like search warrants are concerned.  My (very limited) understanding
	of the law is that because I'm in Canada, if any non-Canadian police
	force wants to compel me to provide them with information, they need
	to talk to their Canadian counterparts and get a Canadian court to
	instruct me to hand over the information.  This would probably take
	a lot of time and effort for people involved; and honestly, if someone
	is using Tarsnap to help them break the law (e.g., if they're creating
	backups of child pornography) I want to be able to help the police.
      </p>
      <p>
	However, I'm serious about saying "at my sole discretion" &mdash; if a law
	enforcement agency wants information, they'd better have a good reason
	for asking for it... and I don't consider the NSA saying "we want to
	have all the information you have, just because we feel like it and
	someone somewhere might be a terrorist" to be a good reason.  Also note
	that unlike the situation with certain illegal wiretaps, I <i>can't</i>
	give your data to anyone, because it's all encrypted such that I can't
	read it.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="PRIVACYINTEREST">Why do I reserve the right to provide
	information about your account if I believe that doing so is in your
	interest?</a></h4>
      <p>
	Because in June 2004,
	<a href="http://www.freebsddiary.org/laptop-stolen-msn.php">Dan
	Langille's laptop was stolen and was seen on MSN</a>, but Microsoft
	wouldn't tell Dan where the laptop was.  If your laptop gets stolen
	and connects to the Tarsnap server to do an automatic backup, I don't
	want to be in the position of worrying about whether it's ok for me to
	tell someone who I think is you but might conceivably not be you what
	IP address your laptop connected from.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="PRIVACYNETWORKADMIN">Why do I reserve the right to provide
	information about your account if it is necessary in order to keep
	Tarsnap running or to diagnose or fix problems with Tarsnap or
	another network?</a></h4>
      <p>
	This one is simple: Things break, and I want to be able to fix them.
	For example, if I get a phone call from a network administrator saying
	"hey, my network is falling over because lots of machines are sending
	huge volumes of data to your server", I want to be able to say "right,
	go talk to you@yourdomain.com, because he's the guy who set up fifty
	machines to do their backups at exactly the same time".
      </p>
      <h4><a name="PAYMENTINADVANCE">Why do people have to pay in advance to
	use Tarsnap?  Why can't you just bill credit cards at the end of each
	month?</a></h4>
      <p>
	There are three major reasons for this:
      </p>
      <ol><li>
	Predictability.  This way, you're not going to get surprised with a
	large bill at the end of the month, and I'm not going to get surprised
	by someone not paying their bill.
      </li><li>
	Simplicity.  Keeping a list of credit card numbers (securely) and
	charging them at the end of each month is complicated; dealing with
	expired/cancelled credit cards, failed charges, etc. would just add
	to the headaches.
      </li><li>
	Economics.  Many people using Tarsnap have less than 1 GB of data
	stored &mdash; that is, they're using less than $0.30/month of storage.
	Given that credit card processors typically take a fee of about
	$0.30 + 2.5% to charge credit cards, charging credit cards every month
	for such small amounts would be a horrible waste of money &mdash; whereas
	having someone deposit $5 which lasts them for the next 16 months works
	out quite reasonably.
      </li></ol>
      <h4><a name="CANADIANADDRESS">Why do you need names and addresses of
	Canadian Tarsnap users?  Why can't they remain anonymous?</a></h4>
      <p>
	I have to remit GST/HST to the government, and the rate depends on
	where you're living.  Arguably this only requires me to know which
	province you're in, but the regulations refer to businesses collecting
	customer <i>addresses</i> and I don't want to get into arguments with
	the Canada Revenue Agency about whether asking for the province alone
	is good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
	Similarly, I'm required to provide invoices which show your name, and
	I can't do that if I don't know your name.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="BCPSTISSTUPID">What's up with the weird price for British
	Columbia residents?</a></h4>
      <p>
	Section 188 of the BC Provincial Sales Tax Act prohibits advertising
	that sales taxes "will be assumed or absorbed by the [vendor]", "will
	not be considered as part of the amount payable", or "will be
	refunded".  This is, of course, the exact opposite of what happens in
	Europe, where VAT is <i>required</i> to be included in advertised
	prices.  Alas, Tarsnap is based on British Columbia, so it has to
	conform with British Columbian legislation, no matter how idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
	So instead of charging 300 picodollars including tax, like I do for
	all other Canadians, I give British Columbians a 3/28ths discount,
	then add sales taxes.  Google, of course, can tell you what
	<a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=267.857143+plus+12%25">267.857143
	plus 12%</a> tax works out to.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="UPDATETERMS">Why should anyone agree to terms and
	conditions which you can unilaterally change?</a></h4>
      <p>
	There are some things which I will almost certainly have to change in
	the future.  One likely point of adjustment is paragraph 7 &mdash; I hope
	that I will be able to lower the price I charge people for using
	Tarsnap at some point &mdash; while another is in paragraph 10 &mdash;
	there will probably be a more streamlined process for closing an account
	and withdrawing unspent funds than "send me an email" at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
	Given that you will always have 30 days' notice before being bound by
	any change (I'm presuming that if I lower the price, nobody will
	insist that they want to be charged the higher rate, but for anything
	more serious than that I certainly plan on giving at least 30 days'
	notice of any changes), I don't think this is a big deal.
