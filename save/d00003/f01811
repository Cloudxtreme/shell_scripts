    <h1>The Apache 2 ITK MPM</h1>

    <p>apache2-mpm-itk (just mpm-itk for short) is an MPM (Multi-Processing
      Module) for the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> web
      server. mpm-itk allows you to run each of your vhost under a separate uid
      and gid&mdash;in short, the scripts and configuration files for one vhost no
      longer have to be readable for all the other vhosts.</p>
      
    <p>mpm-itk is based on the traditional <em>prefork</em> MPM, which means
      it's non-threaded; in short, this means you can run non-thread-aware code
      (like many <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> extensions) without
      problems. On the other hand, you lose out to any performance benefit
      you'd get with threads, of course; you'd have to decide for yourself if
      that's worth it or not. You will also take an additional performance
      hit over prefork, since there's an extra fork per request.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>The latest version is <strong>2.2.17-01</strong>, updated <strong>2011-03-21</strong>.
      You can download the
      <a href="apache2.2-mpm-itk-2.2.17-01/">patch series</a> (apply in order), or
      <a href="apache2.2-mpm-itk-2.2.17-01.patch">monolithic diff</a>.</p>

    <p>There is also a <strong>2.4.4-04</strong> for Apache 2.4 and 2.5.x-pre,
      last updated <strong>2013-02-28</strong>,
      but it's not as widely tested, so you should exercise some caution.
      You can download the <a href="mpm-itk-2.4.4-04.tar.gz">archive</a> here
      (the 2.4 series can be built out-of-tree in some cases, so you may
      no longer have to patch Apache).</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>If you can't apply a patch, you probably should not be using this. :-)
      However, several distributions now include mpm-itk as a choice alongside
      the other MPMs; in alphabetical order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> ports</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></li>
    </ul>
     
    <p>If you know of any I missed, or if you have included mpm-itk in your
      favorite distribution, please drop me a note (see below).
      I'd always be happy to expand this list :-)</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>The new configuration settings over the prefork MPM are:</p>

    <ul> 
      <li><code>AssignUserID</code>: Takes two parameters, uid and gid (or
        really, user name and group name; use “#&lt;uid&gt;” if you want to
        specify a raw uid); specifies what uid and gid the
        vhost will run as (after parsing the request etc., of course).
        Note that if you do not assign a user ID, the default one from
        Apache will be used.</li>
      <li><code>AssignUserIDExpr</code>, <code>AssignGroupIDExpr</code>
        (<em>Apache 2.4 or newer only</em>): Like AssignUserID, but takes in an
        <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/expr.html">Apache expression</a>
        to dynamically choose user or group. See below.</li>
      <li><code>MaxClientsVHost</code>: A separate MaxClients for the vhost.
        This can be useful if, say, half of your vhosts depend on some NFS
        server; if the NFS server goes down, you do not
        want the children waiting forever on NFS to take the non-NFS-dependent
        hosts down. This can thus act as a safety measure, giving “server too
        busy” on the NFS-dependent vhosts while keeping the other ones
        happily running. (Of course, you could use it to simply keep one site
        from eating way too much resources, but there are probably better
        ways of doing that.)</li>
      <li><code>NiceValue</code>: Lets you nice some requests down, to give
        them less CPU time.</li>
      <li><code>LimitUIDRange</code>, <code>LimitGIDRange</code>
        (<em>Apache 2.4 or newer only, for now</em>):
        Restrict setuid() and setgid() calls to a given range (e.g.
        “LimitUIDRange 1000 2000" to allow only uids from 1000 to 2000, inclusive),
        possibly increasing security somewhat. Note that this requires
        seccomp v2 (Linux 3.5.0 or newer). Also, due to technical reasons,
        setgroups() is <em>not</em> restricted, so a rogue process can still
        get any group it might want. Still, performing a successful attack
        will be somewhat trickier than otherwise.</li> 
    </ul>

    <p><code>MaxClientsVHost</code> can only be set inside a <code>VirtualHost</code> directive;
      all others can be set wherever you'd like in the Apache
      configuration, except in .htaccess.</p>

    <p><code>AssignUserIDExpr</code> and <code>AssignGroupIDExpr</code> (new in Apache 2.4) are quite
      powerful, although how to use them is perhaps nonobvious. The easiest
      way to use them is by combining with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>,
      for instance like this:</p>

    <pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule /~([a-z]+)/ - [E=ITKUID:$1]
AssignUserIDExpr %{reqenv:ITKUID}</pre>

    <p>This will cause e.g. <code>/~sesse/foo</code> to be run as the user
      “sesse” (and <code>/~root/foo</code> to be run as user “root”,
      so beware!).</p>

    <h2>Quirks and warnings</h2>

    <p>Since mpm-itk has to be able to setuid(),
      it <em>runs as root</em> (although restricted with POSIX capabilities
      and seccomp v2 where possible) until the request is parsed and the vhost
      determined. This means that <em>any code execution hole before the request
      is parsed</em> will be a potential root security hole. (The most likely place
      is probably in mod_ssl.) This is not likely to change in the near future,
      as socket passing, the most likely alternative solution, is very
      hard to get to work properly in a number of common use cases (e.g. SSL).</p>

    <p>The lack of socket passing also leads to another minor quirk:
      If you connect to httpd, make a request and then make a request on the
      same connection that gets handled by a different uid, mpm-itk simply
      shuts down the connection. This is perfectly legal according to
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.1.4">RFC 2616 section 8.1.4</a>,
      and all major clients seem to handle it well; the web server simply simulates a
      timeout, and the client just opens a new connection and retries the request.
      However, there is a small performance hit, and thus you should avoid including
      content from multiple uids in the same page.</p>

    <p>Note that mpm-itk is nowhere as tested as, say,
      prefork. That being said, it's being run in production at several
      sites in the world, both hobbyist and commercial, some as large as
      ~10 million hits a day.</p>

    <h2>Licensing</h2>

    <p>mpm-itk is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0, like the rest
      of Apache.</p>

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>

    <p>If mpm-itk does not suit your tastes, here are some alternatives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you only run CGI scripts, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/suexec.html">suexec</a>
        will probably solve most of your problems with any MPM. Similarly,
        <a href="http://www.suphp.org/">suPHP</a> provides a PHP-only solution.</li>
      <li>If you are on Solaris, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_privileges.html">mod_privileges</a>,
        part of Apache since 2.4, provides functionality somewhat like mpm-itk.</li>
      <li>There is an MPM similar to mpm-itk called <em>peruser</em>, but it seems
        it no longer has a web site. There is still a 
        <a href="http://www.telana.com/mailman/listinfo/peruser">mailing list</a>,
        though.</li>
      <li>Finally, the Apache wiki has <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PrivilegeSeparation">a
        collection of more-or-less-thought-out ideas</a> that you can try out.</li>
    </ul>
