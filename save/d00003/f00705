<h2>How to download source code for the development version of gnuplot</h2>

Source code for the development version of gnuplot is kept on 
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot">SourceForge</a>.
However, the best way to get the complete set of source is to install
the cvs tools on your own machine and use them to access the SourceForge
site.

<h3>Creating a copy of the CVS source tree on your local machine</h3>
This will create a subdirectory named <b>./gnuplot</b>, and copy the
cvs source tree into it.
<br>
<b>csh version</b>
<pre>
setenv CVS_RSH ssh
setenv CVSROOT ':pserver:anonymous@gnuplot.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot'
cvs login
        (hit &lt;cr&gt; - no password needed for anonymous)
cvs -z3 checkout gnuplot
</pre>
<br>
<b>bash version</b>
<pre>
export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@gnuplot.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot
cvs login

cvs -z3 checkout gnuplot
</pre>
	
<h3>If you just want to build the current version without patching</h3>
If you don't have any patches to apply, at this point you can build
the current CVS version using the following sequence of commands:
<pre>
cd ./gnuplot
./prepare
./configure
make
</pre>
If you want to explore the possible configuration options, you can get
a list by typing
<pre>
./configure --help
</pre>
By default the CVS version has all options turned on, but you might want
to specify some particular prefered external libraries.  The only extra
option I use myself is:
<pre>
./configure --with-readline=gnu
</pre>

<h3>Applying the patches</h3>
Download the patches you want. I will assume you are getting patches from
this site, but you may also want to look at the much longer
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2055&atid=302055">
list of submitted patches at SourceForge</a>. 
I recommend renaming your local copy of the source directory before patching,
so that later on you can update your copy of the CVS source without 
overwriting or colliding with your local patched copy. 
To apply the patches and reconfigure the patched source for your local setup:
<pre>
mv ./gnuplot ./gnuplot-patched
cd ./gnuplot-patched
patch -p1 < ../patch1.patch
patch -p1 < ../patch2.patch
./prepare
./configure --help      (to see the configuration options)
./configure --enable-datastrings --enable-histograms
make
</pre>

The downloaded patches are not always a perfect match to the current
CVS code, because the code keeps getting updated (that's the whole point!).
So you may see warning messages from the <b>patch</b> commands.
You can ignore most of these, but if you see messages like: <pre>
2 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file src/unset.c.rej
</pre>
then you have a problem and will have to fix this particular file by
hand.  If you want to test patch compatibility before actually applying
it, you can use the command <pre>
patch -p1 --dry-run < ../patch1.patch</pre>
