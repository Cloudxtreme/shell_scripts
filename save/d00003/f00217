                        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p><strong>Important HKIX Announcement on New Charging Model</strong></p>
                          <p>HKIX was established in April 1995, using spare resources of   The Chinese University of Hong Kong.  At the onset, HKIX could be offered as a   free-of-charge service to the early participants with moderate network traffic.    But over the years, with the growth in the demand for Internet traffic exchange   and e-business, we have now grown into a critical Internet infrastructure   covering 190+ autonomous systems and exchanging 250+ Gbps of data at peak time.    To support such a huge network, the configuration of HKIX has also evolved from   a primitive coaxial cable to Ethernet switches and to the now top-end equipment   and technologies.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is not possible to leverage the network economy   of the whole Hong Kong with virtually no cost.  In 2005, we introduced the   penalty-based cost-recovering model with a hope to curb abuse and to recover   most of the cost.  After eight years, we find that this extremely conservative   model is not sustainable in front of the exponential growth in network traffic   volume and growth in the demand for new connections.  Together with the higher   expectation of all the participants in the service, it calls for a continuous   upgrade of the HKIX infrastructure in capacity and resilience.  This requires   substantial periodic capital investment and operating expenses.  It is unfair   and impossible for the university to subsidize the operation indefinitely.  In   fact, we have to do a major upgrade in 2013 to cope with the ever-increasing   demand and to improve our resilience further with site resilience at the   core.</p>
<p>In order to make the HKIX operation truly self-sustained in   long term and to prepare for the continuous growth in the future while we could   keep HKIX as a not-for-profit service, we have no choice but to implement a   full-cost-recovery model, i.e. simple port charge model.  This charging   mechanism is actually the industry norm, which is fair and consistent for all   participants.</p>
<p><U><strong>Simple port charge model will be implemented starting   01-JAN-2013 for all new participants and new connection requests.</strong>  For   existing participants with no change of connections, the existing terms and   conditions will not change until 30-JUN-2013.  To further ease the transition,   we shall still provide to each participant up to 2 free FE/GE ports in total   (counting all ports at all HKIX sites) until 30-JUN-2014.  After 30-JUN-2014,   all ports will be chargeable.</U></p>
<p>The new port charges (applied to all HKIX sites) will   be:</p>
<p>FE/GE: US$120/port/month (no one-time connection charge) 10GE: US$1,000/port/month (plus one-time non-refundable   connection charge: LR - US$2,300; ER - US$7,000)</p>
<p>(Exchange Rate: US$1=HK$7.8)</p>
<p>We strongly believe the charges laid down are on the low side   when compared to other parts of the world.  Nevertheless, we shall review the   charges periodically and uphold our principles of fairness and   consistency.</p>
<p>If you have any queries regarding this new arrangement,   please feel free to contact our core team at hkix-core at <A title="http://itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/" href="http://itsc.cuhk.edu.hk">itsc.cuhk.edu.hk</A>.</p>

<p>We thank you for your understanding and wish you’ll have a   Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>

HKIX has been supporting IPv6 since March 2004 and gradual growth of IPv6 traffic has been observed.  As IPv4 address space is running out fast, IPv6 deployment is becoming more urgent than before.  In view of this, HKIX will implement a new scheme starting 10 July 2008 (Thu) that allows HKIX participants to share IPv6 connectivity more easily.  HKIX participants are encouraged to share their IPv6 connectivity with other HKIX participants via HKIX's IPv6 MLPA route server.  With this arrangement, HKIX participants should be able to get wider IPv6 connectivity via HKIX.  We believe that this will encourage more HKIX participants to start IPv6 deployment and so will enable faster IPv6 development.  Please click <a href="ipv6.htm">here</a> for details. </td>

Thus HKIX, which is physically located on the campus of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, has become the de facto internet hub for Hong Kong.
                        <p> In order to enhance reliability and to provide value-added services, HKIX has entered into a collaboration arrangement with CITIC DATA 1616 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the CITIC Pacific group, in order to establish a joint venture, which will in turn operate a second site in Central, Hong Kong. The second site under the joint venture will act as a back-up mirror site, and will also aim to establish Hong Kong as the internet hub for the Asia-Pacific region.
                        </p><p> Details about the joint venture and the arrangements for connection to the second site will be provided later.
