While search-engines are the only way to get a view on all information
which can be found on the global Internet, their results are not
satisfying.  The main reason for this is the unpresedented size and
growth of the information to be searched.
<P>
This talk was presented on June 9 1999, at the TERENA-<WBR>NORDUnet
Networking Conference 1999 (<A HREF=http://www.terena.nl/tnnc/>TNNC</A>):
<I>"The Challenge of Gigabit Networking"</I>.  It covers two papers:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=../TNNC99if/index.html>A Search Interface for My Questions</A>
<LI><A HREF=../TNNC99se/index.html>My Personal Search Engine</A>
</UL>

In one talk, two ideas are presented to solve some of the problems
which may improve the usability of search-engines.  The first is about
the development of an interface which supports the data-mining of a
user much better than current engines do.  The second is about how we
can restructure the search-engines to improve the quality of their data.

<A HREF=http://mark.overmeer.net/>Mark Overmeer</A> got his MSc in
  Informatics from the <A HREF=http://www.kun.nl>University of Nijmegen</A>,
  NL in 1990.  Since then, he gained professional experience in maintaining
  a large variety of UNIX-<WBR>systems, from tiny to super-<WBR>computers.
  In his current occupation, this knowledge is taught to system-<WBR>developers
  and -maintainers at <A HREF=http://www.ATComputing.nl>AT Computing bv</A>,
  a leading training institute on UNIX and UNIX-<WBR>related languages in the
  Netherlands.
  <P>
  Next to his professional activities in computers, he maintains a very
  popular <A HREF=http://www.dhp.nl>Dutch Internet-<WBR>site</A> since 1995,
  and actively participates in development of Public Domain software.
