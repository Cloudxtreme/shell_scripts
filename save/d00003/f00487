<B><U><P>Abstract</P>
</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Working in cooperation with the National Science Foundation since 1992, the Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) has served as an efficient, cost-effective mechanism for assisting the NSF and US scientists to obtain Internet acce


ss in developing areas by facilitating the establishment of connections to the public Internet in developing countries. The existence of these computer networks has greatly benefited the US scientific community and US agencies, as well as the local commun


ities in which the networks now exist. By providing technical advice and engineering assistance to numerous countries around the world, and tracking international connectivity developments, the NSRC has established and maintains an extensive base of conta


cts willing to contribute their time and expertise to further these efforts. Many of the network operators we have catalyzed and trained, and with whom we currently work, are the key personnel that established the first Internet access centers in their re


spective countries. In return, they actively provide training and support in their regions to spread the acquired knowledge, putting special emphasis on scientific institutions when we request their help on behalf of NSF and US scientists. This ultimately


 enhances network operations globally, making it easier for US scientists to exchange data and engage in research projects with their international partners. By also facilitating technical collaboration with our US networking colleagues and previous recip


ients of NSRC assistance, our effectiveness is considerably augmented by a large cadre of volunteer support, thereby providing very high leverage on the use of NSF funds. </P>
<P>The NSRC's work helps US scientists gain ready access to international resources by nurturing networking in areas of the world in which computer-based communications have traditionally been limited. We emphasize technical support and training to engine


ers at academic institutions and research centers in developing areas, with the primary goal of making it easier for US scientists and engineers, and those in developing countries to have the means to collaborate via the Internet.</P>
<P>To date, the NSRC has contributed significantly to the creation of national and regional networks in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, several former Soviet states, the Asia/Pacific region, and to som


e start-up K-12 network systems in the US. Central to the success of the NSRC has been its philosophy of empowering local users -- thereby fostering independence and, most important, sustainability -- together with an emphasis on the use of appropriate, a


ffordable, and scalable technology. </P>
<P>The NSRC's emphasis on training, disseminating information, and providing technical support has contributed significantly to the development of stable computer networks, managed by local hands with local expertise. Widespread recognition of the importa


nce of access to the Internet and of the accrued benefits of networking is an ongoing global development, which the NSF and the initial NSRC project have successfully helped to cultivate. This proposal seeks NSF support to continue our efforts for another


 three years, in assisting the establishment and expansion of developing area networks.</P>

<B><U><P>Overview</P>
</B></U><P>The Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) gathers, organizes, and disseminates information, training, and tools to organizations in developing countries, and underdeveloped areas of the United States, so they can acquire affordable networking 


technology and use it to join the public Internet. We achieve this by responding to specific requests from US scientists who seek help designing and building networks abroad, and by providing direct support to the in-country engineers and system administr


ators. By making available and transferring technology, information, documentation, and training, the NSRC project enhances global networking operations. Supplying networking tools and support to American scientists needing to get connected from remote re


search sites ultimately enhances the success of US scientific endeavors, and benefits all others involved in scientific efforts around the world.</P>
<P>The roots of the Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) trace back to a volunteer effort to support networking in southern Africa in 1988, when Randy Bush designed, taught about, and helped deploy a multi-country (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimba


bwe, and later many others) network using various technologies. Currently, the NSRC functions as a virtual global coordinating clearinghouse and service center working with universities, research institutions, networking organizations, governments, and in


dividuals worldwide. As the original volunteers lent their time and expertise to those requiring assistance to start computer networks, it quickly became clear that there was considerable need for the information the NSRC was providing. Today, there are n


umerous efforts to build networks in the less-connected countries of the world that have neither access to, nor funds for, private consulting assistance, particularly in universities and research institutes. The NSRC model of providing pro bono technical 


assistance to US scientists and the local network engineers, based on specific requests from them, greatly increases the likelihood of establishing sustainable TCP/IP networks. By empowering the network operators with the technical information, tools, and


 training that they request, we are able to hone in on their specific needs, and assist them in steadily enhancing the quality of the networks and the knowledge of the staff maintaining them. </P>
<P>The NSRC's work helps US scientists gain ready access to international resources by nurturing networking in areas of the world in which computer-based communications have traditionally been limited. We emphasize technical support and training to engine


ers at academic institutions and research centers in developing areas, with the primary goal of making it easier for US scientists and engineers, and those in developing countries to have the means to collaborate via the Internet.</P>
<P>To date, the NSRC has contributed significantly to the creation of national and regional networks in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, several former Soviet states, the Asia/Pacific region, and to som


e start-up K-12 network systems in the US. Central to the success of the NSRC has been its philosophy of empowering local users -- thereby fostering independence and, most important, sustainability -- together with an emphasis on the use of appropriate, a


ffordable, and scalable technology. </P>
<P>We propose minimal funding of personnel time and support of networking facilities at a cost of about $265,000 per year, for three more years, to continue helping the nascent engineers and networking infrastructures in developing areas requesting techni


cal assistance. The NSRC and the NSF would benefit from our ongoing collaboration with the University of Oregon Computing Center. Joanne Hugi, Director of the Computing Center, Dave Meyer, Director of the Advanced Network Technology Center (ANTC), and oth


er staff members have regularly offered volunteer assistance to NSRC activities, as necessary. We propose to officially augment NSRC staffing by hiring Hervey Allen at .2 FTE, one of the UO Computing Center technicians who has been particularly useful to 


helping the NSRC achieve its goals. In working with the University of Oregon, the NSRC also provides numerous training and learning opportunities for students seeking networking experience, and this enables them to actively contribute to global Internet d


evelopments. With additional support from NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, we have worked with several undergraduate students and we would propose to engage more undergraduates as part of a new award.</P>
<B><U><P>Statement of Need</P>
</B></U><P>The importance of Internet access and of the accrued benefits of networking is clearly established now in the international scientific community, and the NSF and the initial NSRC project contributed significantly to cultivating this awareness d


uring the past decade. US research and engineering scientists rely on the Internet for collecting data from remote locations and for collaborating with R&amp;E scientists throughout the developing world. Scientists travelling abroad now regularly use the 


Internet for communicating with colleagues and relaying data back to their home facilities in the US. The ease and timeliness of communication permitted by the dynamic functioning of the Internet contributes significantly to the success of international c


ollaborative research and development projects.</P>
<P>The major goal of helping to develop TCP/IP connectivity to developing countries has largely been achieved, with at least one gateway connection now in almost all of the capital cities in the world. However, penetration to secondary cities and rural ar


eas, where scientific research sites are often located, has been problematic. Low density of telephone lines, poor quality telecommunications infrastructure, expensive international links for the country's universities and Internet Service Providers, and 


solving last kilometer problems continue to hinder more widespread access and availability.</P>
<P>A prime example is the ongoing efforts by the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health to make Internet technology available to scientists at malaria research sites in Africa, who wish to collaborate with colleagues in the US. Several


 malaria research centers in Mali, Kenya, Tanzania, Cameroon, and other countries, have requested assistance with obtaining Internet connectivity so that they can access databases and medical literature in the US and communicate more easily with US resear


chers and scientists who are helping to combat the continent's malaria problem. NLM/NIH is currently addressing this request by using NLM/NIH funds for site assessments, technical planning, purchasing and installing equipment, and providing training to he


lp build networks in some of Africa's remote malaria research sites. However, once the initial links are in place, there will be ongoing technical issues with training of local personnel, maintaining the local networks, and building new ones. NLM/NIH rece


ntly contacted the NSRC regarding collaboration with several of their potential partners; our role would be to provide training, documentation, and support to the local system administrators, particularly in the early phases of establishing the networks. 


We are currently discussing ways to enhance each other's work, so we can effectively assist our colleagues in Africa with acquiring better access to US information resources and expertise via the Internet. </P>
<P>In summary, the needs outlined in the two previous NSRC proposals have changed. As the networks in a country or region mature, and the user base grows, the needs shift from obtaining initial IP connectivity to more complex engineering problems, such as


 setting up cooperative exchange points to keep local traffic off of the thin international links. Another topic that we're seeing more frequently now is how to design efficient user support/help desk systems, as the TCP/IP networks are operational, and t


he user base is growing rapidly.</P>
<P>The NSRC’s model of providing technical assistance, based on specific requests from groups that seek information and engineering advice, increases the likelihood for establishing sustainable TCP/IP networks. As the technology progresses, and the needs 


of our constituency evolve, the NSRC efficiently adapts to address the technical needs, as expressed by the engineers, scientists, and network operators calling for assistance.</P>
<B><U><P>Results from Prior NSF Support (NSF Grants NCR-9216064 and NCR-9616597)</P>
</B></U><P>The NSRC was awarded an initial three-year NSF grant through the International Nutrition Foundation in October 1992 to formalize the NSRC, which had been staffed entirely by volunteers prior to that. The NSRC moved its base of operations to the


 University of Oregon Computing Center in 1996, where a second NSF award began in October 1996. With the help of these two grants, the NSRC has built an organizational base for disseminating networking information to many engineers, universities, and Inte


rnet Service Providers around the world, during a time when interest in connecting to the Internet has grown at an unprecedented rate worldwide. NSF support to the NSRC has been instrumental in enabling us to provide assistance to scientists and network e


ngineers in need of technical help while building connections to the Internet. </P>
<P>Since the second NSF award began in fiscal year 1996, we have responded to well over one thousand requests for information and technical assistance from US scientists, developing country scientists and engineers, and developing area network operators. 


Following are a few representative examples of requests for assistance that the NSRC has received, and addressed, along with some other program highlights.</P>

<UL>
<LI>American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) -- we assisted John Schoneboom with a AAAS pilot project to make scientific journals available online to universities in Senegal, Ghana, Uganda, and Zambia. The NSRC provided information about


 caching techniques for making scientific journals available over low-bandwidth Internet links to the research sites in Africa. We introduced AAAS to an NSRC colleague in South Africa who accompanied Schoneboom to each of the pilot sites at the participat


ing African universities to perform some tests, install software, etc.</LI>
<LI>Johns Hopkins University -- Bob Kambic from the School of Public
Health asked NSF for assistance with establishing Internet connectivity
for some researchers in Uganda that are collaborating with JHU. The NSRC
engaged a longtime Ugandan colleague, Charles Musisi, to do a needs
assessment for the two sites -- one for a group of Ugandan AIDS
researchers, and the other to build a computer lab with Internet access for researchers at the Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics, Makerere University. We are currently hosting web sites for various Ugandan organizations, providing remote POP m


ail services, UUCP mail services, and coordinating with Charles Musisi on designing and building LANs at each site. The NSRC also sent fourteen boxes containing PCs, Cat 5 cable, networking books, tools, and spare computer parts to JHU to join a larger sh


ipment of equipment being sent to Uganda by JHU.</LI>

<LI>Book Donations and Building Technical Libraries </LI>

<P>The NSRC has developed cooperative working relationships with O'Reilly and Associates, John Wiley &amp; Sons, and Cisco Press to provide networking and computer science reference books to developing area networks, where technical documentation is often


 expensive, and difficult to obtain. These companies have donated more than $25,000 worth of technical books in both English and French to the NSRC. We use the books to help build technical libraries in locations where the resources can be freely shared -


 engineering and computer science departments, university libraries, and centrally-based networking facilities. Since creating this aspect of the NSRC in 1992, we have shipped hundreds of technical reference books to network engineers and university profe


ssors in Angola, Benin, Cambodia, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Panama, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Senega


l, Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, and Uganda. The financial support provided by the National Science Foundation to cover the shipping costs of the donated books has resulted in a valuable service for network engineers, computer science professors, and s


tudents in information-deprived areas of the world. This small amount of assistance builds tremendous goodwill for NSF in the universities, research centers, and network training facilities of the developing world.</P>
<LI>Assisting US scientists travelling abroad with nurturing nascent networking services</LI>
<LI>A representative example is the ongoing work we are doing with Cliff
Missen from the University of Iowa who is on a one-year Fulbright to the University of Jos in central Nigeria. In addition to teaching, Missen is coordinating an effort to get the University of Jos connected to the Internet. The NSRC regularly responds to


 requests from Missen and the Nigerian networkers for technical information, explanations about the administrative procedures of connecting to the Internet, and contacts for satellite providers, xDSL, and wireless equipment. We shipped technical reference


 books to the networking group at the University, and recently sent some computing equipment donated to the NSRC.

<LI>In July 1998, an ISP in Angola that the NSRC had previously assisted requested help with designing efficient user support services. They migrated from FidoNet to TCP/IP, and within a short amount of time had more than one thousand users, including the


 US Embassy and other US personnel in Angola. We sent Hervey Allen, from the University of Oregon's Help Desk services to Luanda for two weeks to work with the ISP, the local university, and the local telecommunications provider on devising an effective h


elp desk strategy, given the limited local resources. Allen taught them how to make their own pre-configured auto-installers for PPP dial-up, and other net tools, how to make their own CD containing all the software, and how to write some detailed "help" 


documentation for handouts and WWW publication.</LI>
<LI>Tracking and archiving information on the startup and evolution of networking in developing countries -- organized on a regional and per-country basis. This information is available in a distributed database (Java web server + mySQL) at http://www.nsr


c.org/. The new system allows network operators and networking colleagues around the world to submit and edit data about their respective networks.</LI>
<LI>Lobbying for the needs of low bandwidth networks outside the USA in the forums of international network engineering and administrative decision-making institutions.</LI>
<LI>Hosted trainees from Argentina, Peru, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Uganda - some of whom went home with the equipment we procured with them, and on which we trained them, and promptly established their national networks.</LI>
<LI>The Guide to Administrative Procedures of the Internet Infrastructure - we produced this document prior to the INET 1998 workshop in Geneva and made it available to the student participants in all tracks. Following the workshop, we translated it into 


French and distributed the document at regional networking workshops in Senegal and Benin. Finally, the document has been translated into Spanish for use in Latin American network training events. It was recently revised and submitted for publication as a


n Informational RFC.</LI>
<LI>Student Learning Opportunities -- as a supplement to the NSRC core grant, we received a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) award to experiment with a set of web and SNMP-based tools for large scale network monitoring. A Computer and Informa


tion Science student at the UO developed a program to query routers and display the status of the links between them. Working with guidance from the PI and UO Computing Center staff, the student developed a simple language to describe a network topology, 


and experimented with using shared memory when probing routers in parallel, user interface designs in Java, multiple program integration, and tools for displaying network topologies. Languages and tools employed include shell scripts, Perl, Java, ping, an


d SNMP. Other undergraduate and graduate students have assisted the NSRC with web site administration and database development, researching Internet routing problems, researching and writing networking case studies, and responding to email inquiries for i


nformation. In total, more than a dozen students have participated and benefited from the NSRC being based at the University of Oregon. The NSRC and the UO's Advanced Network Technology Center are currently working together to design a network operations 


center (NOC) tool, employing three graduate students and two undergraduate students as part of the research and development team. </LI>
<LI>ARIN and other Regional Registry Services - Bush participated in the creation of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). He spent a significant amount of time working to get ARIN approved, and was a founding member of the Board of Trustees.


 The NSRC has also been helping Latin America and Africa to develop their own regional registry services for IP numbers. </LI></UL>

<P>Some examples of planning and engineering assistance to developing country networking initiatives, and support to US scientists using the networks, include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>We currently work with several Ugandan projects operating in cooperation with Makerere University to help get more of Uganda's academics on the Internet. There are also US researchers who use our remote POP mail server while working in Uganda. </LI>
<LI>In June 1997, we were contacted by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Panamanian Secretariat for Science and Technology (SENACYT) to help set up a neutral exchange point for cooperative use by the Panamanian academic network, Red Acad&e


acute;mica y De Investigaci&oacute;n Nacional (PANNet), and all significant commercial providers. Bush and Dave Meyer trained the participating engineers in Panama about BGP, peering points, the Internet Routing Registry, Autonomous Systems, built the too


ls to automate configuration, and helped set up the InteRed exchange point in July 1997 - the first open, cooperative IX in Latin American and Caribbean networks.</LI>
<LI>Dominican Republic<B> </B>- We received a request from an engineer at the Instituto Tecnol&oacute;gico de Santo Domingo (INTEC) regarding ways to enhance the backbone of their academic network. We outlined some suggestions, and introduced him to Dr. S


aul Hahn of the Organization of American States (OAS). A project to connect the six main universities in the country has been established and the NSRC provided some assistance with the design of the network, and procurement of routers, workstations, CSUs/


DSUs, etc. The six universities are now connected, some at 128kbps and others at 64kbps, and several scientific departments at the various universities are actively using the Internet for participation in international collaborative projects and scientifi


c exchanges. The NSRC also provided a large shipment of O'Reilly technical books for the engineers at the participating universities, and to create a technical library at INTEC.</LI>
<LI>Assisted Liberia with arranging IP connectivity, and procuring earth station equipment to connect to PAS-3. With assistance from several NSRC colleagues, we guided Liberian networkers through the technical and administrative steps to procure and confi


gure servers, routers, and get the network securely on the Internet. At the request of the Liberian network operator, we facilitated registration of the country's Top Level Domain, and currently run the primary nameserver for .LR, while helping the admini


strative point of contact learn more about managing DNS. </LI>
<LI>In 1996, we worked with Bill Sangiwa to bring up Tanzania's first connection to the Internet, with assistance from a longtime NSRC colleague at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, Nabil Bukhalid, who had experience configuring Ciscos for IP 


over X.25 encapsulation. </LI>
<LI>At the request of FidoNet operators and US researchers working in Kenya, the National Science Foundation supported the NSRC's work to design, install, and train local engineers for the first TCP/IP links to Kenya. </LI>
<LI>The US National Academy of Sciences, the Government of Indonesia, and the World Bank asked the NSRC to catalyze and design the Indonesian academic network, IPTEKnet, which we did during 1995-96.</LI>
<LI>During 1994-95, the NSRC assisted Sri Lankan engineers to design and deploy Sri Lanka's first TCP/IP link.</LI>
<LI>Guinea – beginning in 1994, NSRC provided a cost-recovery only UUCP connection in support of a World Bank education project; access to the network was openly available to anyone, and has been used by many different groups, including the national unive


rsity. As there was not a single phone at the university, we used spread spectrum radio modems within Conakry. We advised a US scientist doing plant research in Guinea on how to obtain network access to support her research and relay data back to her proj


ect sponsor in the US.</LI>
<LI>Mauritania – Huter and Bush worked with ORSTOM-S&eacute;n&eacute;gal to establish a UUCP
email link to a science department at the University of Nouakchott, and we shipped them a supply of technical reference books for faculty and students to share.</P></DIR>


<UL>
<LI>We have worked for several years with Saudi Arabian academics to help them connect to the Internet, learn about DNS, routing, and TCP/IP network design.</LI>
<LI>In response to a request from Egyptian network engineers, we provided technical help to the Egyptian Universities Network to set up Egypt's first link to the Internet in 1993. </LI>
<LI>In 1991, a major university in Peru asked the NSRC for technical assistance to help connect Peru to the Internet. With some financial support from UNDP and Union Latina, the NSRC facilitated the technical work and training for the first networking wit


hin Peru and to establish the links to the US. The NSRC was Peru's UUCP link to the outside world for more than two years until Peru was able to upgrade to a 64kbps, then 128kbps, and then 512kbps satellite IP link. </LI>
<LI>Hosting Web Sites, Mailing Lists, DNS, and Electronic Mail Support</LI></UL>
<DIR>

<P>The NSRC provides primary nameservice for several country code Top Level Domains, and secondary nameservice for several thousand zones in developing country networks. We have a student assistant at the University of Oregon Computing Center who helps wi


th this, which enhances his opportunities for learning about DNS and developing area networks. The NSRC currently hosts or mirrors web servers for universities and research networks in Uganda, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo


, and a particularly large one for Peru. We host numerous mailing lists for scientific projects in Belize, Tanzania, Uganda, a regional list for trade and commerce in Latin America, and a technical TCP/IP support list for hundreds of network engineers all


 over the world. We still provide UUCP email exchanges for some academic/research sites in Belize, Guatemala, Uganda and the Congo, remote POP mail services for travelling US scientists and developing area Internet users in need. </P></DIR>


<UL>
<LI>Over the years, the NSRC has provided cost-recovery only PPP and UUCP links for universities, schools, and research organizations in South Africa, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Peru, Belize, Guinea, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Indonesia, Cambodia, Guatemala, the


 Comoros Islands, and Liberia, as part of startup efforts to get those countries connected to the Internet. In doing so, the NSRC has been careful not to compete with commercial providers, or with NSFNET connectivity arrangements, but has acted as a stepp


ing-stone for these sites, while assisting them in developing more 'normal' arrangements.</LI></UL>

<B><U><P>Proposed Activities</P>
</U><P>Technical Assistance and Coordination </P>
</B><P>Facilitating the installation of sustainable networks is largely dependent on access to information about regional initiatives, potential collaborators, technology alternatives, access providers, equipment suppliers, and putting potential donors of


 equipment or funding together with recipients. An important part of this network development strategy is pulling information together about efforts going on in parallel that might be coordinated in ways to leverage both into higher-quality services. </P>



<P>At the implementation level, the NSRC proposes to continue providing information in the following ways to those who need it:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Helping US scientists and networking personnel obtain data regarding availability of overseas connections. As a means of propagating this information, we maintain a distributed database about connectivity providers and international networking develop


ments at http://www.nsrc.org/, and we continue to respond to numerous email inquiries about the status of networking in country X;</LI>
<LI>Sending books to engineers setting up supportive networks in developing countries, as previously described;</LI>
<LI>Answering technical questions and giving technical advice to engineers in developing countries who are maintaining and/or setting up networks used by US scientists;</LI>
<LI>Facilitating country code Top Level Domain (TLD) delegations, and mediating ccTLD problems;</LI>
<LI>Hosting and participating in mailing lists that support developing connectivity overseas; and,</LI>
<LI>Lobbying for technology at the IETF and other Internet design forums, which takes into account scalability issues for low-bandwidth, developing area networks.</LI></UL>

<B><P>Direct Engineering and Planning Assistance </P>
</B><P>The NSRC and our affiliated consulting staff have designed and installed networks, and trained engineers and network operators in developing areas, i.e. Southern Africa, Peru, Egypt, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Guinea, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Togo, Liberia,


 Uganda, etc. We have done this in response to specific requests from the network managers in these networks. </P>
<P>As costs are extremely variable, consulting is not specifically budgeted in detail. Each case has been different, and the funding agencies have varied from NSF to the World Bank, AAAS, the National Academy of Sciences, and others. At the direction of, 


and in collaboration with NSF, the NSRC would help locate training resources and appropriate personnel to provide engineering training for networks requesting assistance. In the Summary Proposal Budget, we have included a small amount of funding for consu


lting as there are sometimes occasions when it would be appropriate to cover travel expenses and provide a small honorarium to consultants who would work in conjunction with NSRC personnel. Specific consultants, when needed, would be reviewed with the app


ropriate NSF program officer. </P>
<B><P>Hosting Engineer Interns </P>
</B><P>Books and workshops are critical, but hands on experience in operating larger networks gives a new network engineer perspective and confidence which is not available by any other means. We have been doing this informally for the past several years,


 and the results have been very positive. </P>
<P>A typical internship varies in duration from two weeks to two months, and consists largely of sitting shoulder to shoulder with peers operating real networks in the US. Examples of past internship activities include: UNIX training, building BSD UUCP sy


stems and SMTP gateways for UUCP, building and configuring a T1 POP, constructing prototypes of systems to be installed in home country networks (in the cases of Sri Lanka and Kenya, the actual systems were built and shipped after the engineers were train


ed on them), touring US university networks, learning about how to build an exchange point, and attending IETF and NANOG meetings. </P>
<P>The University of Oregon has assisted with hosting and training engineering interns and would continue to do so under the auspices of the Advanced Network Technology Center. Travel, housing and other living expenses would have to be provided on a cost 


recovery basis, largely depending on the organization that requests the training. </P>
<B><P>Organizing Workshops </P>
</B><P>Hands-on training has proven to be the most effective tool for bringing new network staff up to speed. The NSRC and, more recently, many of our former students, have been involved in numerous training workshops around the world. The goal of some of


 these sessions has been actual installation of a network connection, while others have taken place in locations where network connections already exist, for more advanced training purposes. </P>
<P>The NSRC initiated a series of TCP/IP training workshops for engineers from developing countries, which were held at Stanford University, California in August 1993, and became what is now known globally as the INET workshops. Bush was the instigator, t


he coordinator, and the lead instructor for the INET'93 training program, working with Geoff Sears, Steve Fram, Scott Weikart, John Klensin, and other NSRC colleagues. The NSRC also participated in the planning, organization, and teaching of the Universit


y of Hawaii INET workshop in 1995, the 1996 INET workshop in Montreal, Canada in 1996, INET '97 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and INET'98 in Geneva, Switzerland. Since the Stanford workshop, the NSRC has hosted and facilitated the TCPWS mailing list, which p


rovides a forum for students of TCP/IP workshops in which we've participated with a place to ask questions for technical assistance once they've returned home from the training. </P>
<P>The NSRC has also participated in coordinating, organizing, and teaching various NATO, United Nations, and Soros Foundation sponsored workshops in Russia, the Ukraine, and Armenia. Bush gave a routing workshop at CICESE in Ensenada, Mexico for academic


 networks, and co-taught a routing workshop with David Meyer at the VI Foro Permanente de Redes de Am&eacute;rica Latina y el Caribe in Santiago, Chile. Bush also instructed with Alvise Nobile at the first network training workshop held in Trieste, Italy 


in 1992, and with Ermanno Pietrosemoli at the first Escuela Latinoamericana de Redes</P>
<P>(EsLaRed) in M&eacute;rida, Venezuela in November 1992, which was an outgrowth of the Trieste training.</P>
<P>The NSRC emphasizes training new leadership in various countries so that primary responsibility for the work can be shifted to the senior network engineers of the respective regions. The NSRC’s approach to "train the trainers" is an effective model tha


t we’ve consistently promoted in catalyzing many of the international TCP/IP workshops that are now quite popular around the world. </P>
<P>NSRC would be willing to organize and help staff task-specific technical workshops at the request of NSF and other organizations that promote research and education networking in the developing world. Workshops are not specifically budgeted as costs ar


e extremely variable. As an extension of this task, the NSRC will, at the direction of and in collaboration with NSF, utilize supplemental resources to specifically seed network training and development activities in selected critical areas.</P>
<B><P>Help Desk/User Support Services</P>
</B><P>When asked, the NSRC is willing to provide advice and training to universities and ISPs that express a need for developing help desk services to support their users. Hervey Allen and the rest of the UO's user support team have offered to provide as


sistance, documentation, software, tools, and training to groups that request help in this area. This can be quite important, particularly for a visiting US scientist that wants to use a local network facility. Having reliable and effective support servic


es in place helps the network operate more efficiently, which can save users considerable time and resources.</P>
<B><P>Coordinating Equipment Donations</P>
</B><P>In many cases, we have observed that the critical factor preventing a network from being put into place is a single piece of hardware that is not very expensive, but may be difficult to procure in developing areas. When possible, we have coordinate


d donations of hardware by bringing donors and recipients together. The NSRC has received donations from commercial Internet Service Providers and university networks of decommissioned equipment, such as modems, PCs, terminal servers, routers, cabling, et


c. that we have been able to pass on to emerging networks. A recent example is the fourteen boxes of hardware that we relayed to NSF colleagues at Johns Hopkins University who are helping Makerere University in Uganda with building two departmental LANs.<


/P>
<P>We propose to continue soliciting donations of hardware, reconditioning them for use in developing country networks, as needed. We plan to further develop the framework we have established, including ways to match those who have equipment to donate wit


h those who have expressed need for a particular piece of hardware. We are not asking NSF for any funding to support this aspect of our efforts, as funds for shipping can probably be obtained elsewhere.</P>
<B><U><P>Conclusion </P>
</B></U><P>The Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) has proven to be a cost-effective, technically efficient mechanism for facilitating the establishment of TCP/IP networks in developing countries and for enhancing networking activity globally. The deve


lopment of international computer networks has had a demonstrable positive impact on the US scientific community, and other US agencies, as well as for the local communities in which the networks are established. </P>
<P>The NSRC brings considerable experience and perspective in designing and deploying Internet technology. Moreover, the extensive international contacts we have established and maintain are willing to contribute their time and expertise to enhancing glob


al network operations, as evidenced by their participation in past NSRC activities. The tremendous goodwill that this small investment builds for NSF in developing universities and research institutions is well worth the long-term gain. </P>
<P>We propose minimal funding for another three years to continue assisting the local engineers and networks in the less connected parts of the world, by making available and transferring the requested tools, technology, information, and training necessar


y for strengthening international networking operations.<FONT SIZE=2> </P></FONT></BODY>
