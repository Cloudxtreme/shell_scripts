<li> <b>"Understanding and Deploying LDAP Directory Services LDAP
    System Administration", also known as The LDAP Bible</b>

  <p> By Timothy A. Howes, Marc C. Smith and Gordon S. Good, Second
    Edition, 2003, 936 pages, ISBN 10: 0-672-32316-8. Addison-Wesley.</p>

<li> <b> Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++ (Recipes for
    Cryptography, Authentication, Input Validation & More) </b>
 
  <p>By John Viega, Matt Messier, First Edition, July 2003, 790 pages,
  ISBN 10: 0-596-00394-3 | ISBN 13: 9780596003944</p>

<li> <b>"Secure Coding: Principles and Practices"</b>

  <p> By Mark G. Graff, Kenneth R. van Wyk, First Edition, June
  2003, 224 pages, ISBN 10: 0-596-00242-4 | ISBN 13:
  9780596002428 </p> 
  
  <p> The first pages of the book provide an impressive list of
  positive reviews made by many people from the security field; Those 
  could be summarized the following way: "a must-read". Those comments
  associated with the topic (mostly the "secure coding practices" part
  of the title), the limited length of the book and its availability
  (I did not bought it myself; and O'Reilly web site advertises it as
  out of print) finished to convince me to read it. </p>

  <p> As I expected some C (or even other languages) examples and
  other practical advices, I was very disappointed: AFAICT, the book
  mostly contains advices that I classify in the "common sense" or
  "basic security awareness" categories. </p> 

  <p> Simply put, I would not recommend it if you look for a book with
  low level, language, design, or system specific information. If you
  are security-unaware, it may be a good starting point (there may be
  others). </p>

  <p> n.b.: in the same library I found this book, I also found
  O'Reilly "Secure Programming Cookbook (for C an C++)", which clearly
  looks more promising (but also longer, with 790 pages). </p>

<li> <b>"Linux System Programming (Talking Directly to the kernel and C Library"</b>

  <p> By Robert Love, First Edition, September 2007, 388
    pages, ISBN 10: 0-596-00958-5 | ISBN 13: 9780596009588. O'Reilly.</p>

  <p> After reading Love's book on Linux's system call and C library 
  API, I just thought this was an easily readable book, but definitely
  not an advanced book on the topic. In the end, I learned some
  interesting facts and discovered functions I was not aware of but
  that's all.</p>  

  <p> So, is the book worth buying? If you are looking for an overview
  of the topic with small examples of code, it should be ok but there
  may be better way to spend your money if you are already familiar
  with C development. In the end, I would not recommend it.</p> 
 
  <p> While writing this comment, I looked at other reader's comments
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/product/0596009585/">here</a> 
   and found them helpful:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Not quite deep enough"</li>
    <li>"Well written and enjoyable to read"</li>
    <li>"I like his other books though"</li>
    <li>"Some socket programming examples would be nice"</li>
    <li>"I'm still hungry"</li>
  </ul>

  <p> In the end, I will buy "Advanced Programming in the UNIX
    Environment," by W. Richard Stevens, and  "Programming 
    with POSIX Threads," by David R. Butenhof in order to
    compare them with Love's book. Then, I'll update the comment. </p>

<li> <b>"LDAP System Administration"</b>

  <p> By Gerald Carter, First Edition, March 2003, 308
    pages, ISBN 10: 1-56592-491-6 | ISBN 13: 9781565924918. O'Reilly.</p>

  <p> Quickly put, I was disappointed by the book. I would not write
  it is a bad book but my opinion is that spending the additional
  bucks and buy the Second Edition of <b>Understanding and Deploying
  LDAP Directory Services</b> (also known as the LDAP Bible. See
  comments above) is definitely a better choice. </p>

  <p> I expected Gerald Carter's book would cover in great details
  the multiple aspects of the protocol so that I would acquire a deep 
  understanding of how the different elements fit together; but the
  purpose of the book is elsewhere: It is more oriented towards
  practical examples. </p>

  <p> If you happen to have a problem or need to do more (SASL
  EXTERNAL mechanism using TLS client authentication for instance)
  you will have to dig into RFC or buy the LDAP Bible.</p>

<li> <b>"Learning Python, Third Edition"</b>
  
  <p>By Mark Lutz, October 2007, ISBN 10: 0-596-51398-4, ISBN 13:
  9780596513986. O'Reilly.</p> 

  <p> If you want to <b>learn</b> Python, this book is simply
  great. It has an excellent coverage of the language. It is well
  written and clearly benefits from the time Mark Lutz spent learning
  Python to student of its training.</p>
  
  <p>Note that this third edition covers 2.4 and 2.6 but also has very
  interesting notes on the future of the language (new features and
  deprecated one).</p> 

  <p> Also note that if you already know Python, the reading is still
  interesting but you might notice afterwhile that some advanced
  aspects of the language are not covered: metaclasses, decorators,
  threading, ... If you are interested by those topics, do not expect
  associated answers in the book. Instead, you should pitch on "Python
  Cookbok" or "Programming Python" (both are commented in this page). </p>
</li>

<li> <b>"SSL and TLS - Designing and building secure systems"</b>
  
  <p> By Eric Rescorla. First Edition, October 2000, 528 pages,
  ISBN-10: 0201615983 | ISBN-13: 978-0201615982. O'Reilly.</p>

  <p> If you are interested by SSL/TLS, this book is simply the best
  one you can find. If you intend to implement SSL/TLS, work on the
  protocol or simply want to understand it, buy the book. </p>

  <p> The book exposes all aspects of the protocol, provides
  differences and improvements between versions. Explanations are
  backed by figures, commented dumps of sessions, code samples. It is
  both didactic and complete.</p>

  <p> This is the kind of book where you can see that the author
  masters its subject and his obvious will to share that knowledge
  with the reader. </p>

  <p> My only regret is that there is no second edition of the book
  that would cover more recent versions (TLS 1.1, ...) and extensions
  of the protocol normalized by the IETF since its publication. But I
  am nitpickking ;-). </p>
