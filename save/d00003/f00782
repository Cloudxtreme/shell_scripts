<h2>
On how rename is broken in Mac OS X
</h2>
<i>[Please see the latest update at the <a href="#21sep2011">bottom of
this page</a>]</i>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
From rename(2), on my Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.2) laptop :
<p>
<tt>
The <b>rename</b>() system call guarantees that an instance of
<u>new</u> will always exist, even if the system should crash in the
middle of the operation.
</tt>
<p>
Basically, what apple is saying here is that the rename system call is
<em>atomic</em> : there should never be a time where
<tt><u>new</u></tt> doesn't exist for the duration of the execution of
the system call, and that after rename completes, the operation is
either completed succesfully or failed (eg. because the filesystem is
read-only). For more details on how <tt>rename()</tt> is supposed to
work, please read
<a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/rename.html">
the SU specification</a>. In this document I will empirically prove
that <tt>rename()</tt> is not atomic in Mac OS X.
<h3>Details and test method</h3>
<p>
Let's see how the above works out if we're renaming symbolic links. It
should provide us with the means to "relink" atomically, something
<tt>ln&nbsp;-sfh</tt> doesn't provide as this simply deletes the
target (if it exists) and creates a new symlink in its place. Atomic
relinking can be useful in several situations, and the canonical way
to do this on unix systems is by using the <tt>rename()</tt> system
call : first create a symlink to the new destination with a temporary
filename, then rename that temporary filename to the intended name.
Something like the following :
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int
main () {
	symlink("DESTINATION", "templink");
	rename("templink", "LINK");
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
There is an easy way to empirically prove that <tt>rename()</tt> is
<b>not</b> atomic on Leopard 10.5.2. All you have to do is create a
link to a directory, replace that link with a link to another
directory and in the mean time <tt>touch(1)</tt> a file in the
directory the link points to. If you do this often enough, you'll run
into occasions where you get an error message from touch, complaining
that there's "No such file or directory". Let's give this a shot.
<p>
In one shell, type the following :
<pre>
mkdir -p /tmp/test/{A,B}
cd /tmp/test
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; linkit.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int
main () {
        while (1) {
                symlink("A", "templink");
                rename("templink", "link");
                symlink("B", "templink");
                rename("templink", "link");
        }
}
EOF
cc -o linkit linkit.c
./linkit
</pre>
<p>
What we have just done is write, compile and start a program that
continuously points a symlink called "link" first to directory A and
then to directory B and back to A, to B, to A, etc. Now, we need to
touch a file in the directory that symlink "link" points to.
<p>
In a second shell, run the following command :
<pre>
while :; do touch /tmp/test/link/C; done
</pre>
<h3>Result and conclusions</h3>
<p>
This should continuously touch either /tmp/test/A/C or /tmp/test/B/C,
depending on where the link points. Now, if <tt>rename()</tt> is
atomic, this will always succeed. However, after some runtime, you
will get the following error message :
<p>
<tt>touch: /tmp/test/link/C: No such file or directory</tt>
<p>
We can only get this error message if there is no symbolic link called
'link', or if the link points to a non-existent directory. This goes
against the principle of atomicity, so therefor we must conclude that
<tt>rename()</tt> <em>is not atomic on Mac OS X</em>. My best guess is
that the OS simply takes a shortcut in this case and does a delete
first and then quickly follows up with the actual renaming, similar to
the <tt>ln&nbsp;-sfh</tt> way of doing it, so without taking the
necessary precautions to guarantee atomicity. During my tests, I even
got the error message '<tt>touch: /tmp/test/link/C: Is a
directory</tt>', something I can offer no explanation for since C
should either be a file (if link points to A or B) or the path to C
(link) doesn't exist. And besides, touching a directory shouldn't
fail, so it's a weird error for touch to give. In order to get this
fixed I have filed a bug report with apple, its BugID is 5799661.
<p>
Running this same procedure on a Linux, a FreeBSD and an OpenBSD
machine gives no such error messages. This is to be expected if
<tt>rename()</tt> is indeed atomic but <em>does not prove it !</em>

<h4>Update August 26, 2008:</h4>
<p>
I have received an acknowledgement from Apple on my bug report. Here's
a quick quote from their e-mail :
<p>
<div class="quote"><tt>
This is a follow up to Bug ID# 5799661. After further investigation it
has been determined that this is a known issue, which is currently
being investigated by engineering. This issue has been filed in our
bug database under the original Bug ID# 5398777. The original bug
number being used to track this duplicate issue can be found in the
State column, in this format: Duplicate/OrigBug#.
</tt></div>
<p>
Unfortunately, this also means that I have lost all visibility into
the state of this bug. Since my Bug ID is closed as 'Duplicate' and I
have no access to bugs I did not file, I will have to wait for new Mac
OS X versions to see if this problem is fixed.
<p>
<h4>Update September 17, 2008:</h4>
<p>
Today Mac OS X Software Update informed me that there was an update
for Leopard. Unfortunately, upgrading to 10.5.5 makes no difference,
the issue is still there. That's the third upgrade since I reported
this issue that does not fix it.
<p>
<h4>Update January 4, 2009:</h4>
<p>
After updating to Mac OS X 10.5.6 some time ago, I decided to try
again. Issue still there, nothing new here. Maybe (just maybe) it'll
be fixed in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/snowleopard/">Snow
Leopard</a> (Mac OS X 10.6), so I'll try again once that's released
(should be somewhere mid '09). So no more updates for minor versions
until then (except, of course, if a minor version fixes this problem).
<p>
<h4>Update September 4, 2009:</h4>
<p>
Snow Leopard arrived. It was hard to actually acquire a copy (way to
go, Apple), but eventually I managed. There are hardly any new
features visible to the user, so maybe they fixed their bugs this
release ? Sadly, no. Mac OS X 10.6 still suffers from the same
problem. I seem to get a similar amount of "No such file or directory"
errors and after some more runtime, I also get the "Is a directory"
error. Guess that if I want this issue fixed, I'll have to wait for
Mac OS XI (or would that be Mac OS Y ?).
<p>
<h4>Update January 8, 2010:</h4>
<p>
I just received an e-mail from an Apple employee who was very kind to
inform me that the original bug (5398777) was resolved in Snow Leopard
but the issue I reported was not fixed. As I mentioned in the August
26th, 2008 update, I have no access to bug reports that are not my own
so I was not aware of this fix. My original issue has been reopened as
7519910.
<p>
Unfortunately, that means I still do not have any visibility on
Apple's progress in fixing this issue, but I do believe it is now on
their radar again. So, hopefully, this will be solved in the not too
distant future :)
<p>
Thanks to that friendly Apple guy for taking the time to inform me of
this update.
<p>
<h4>Update November 13, 2010:</h4>
<p>
After the upgrade to 10.6.5 I thought I'd check again. It's been more
than 2.5 years since I reported this to Apple, but it's still broken.
I do seem to get less "Is a directory" errors (but I do still get
them).
<p>
I should probably give up any remaining hope I had left in me for a
fix, the issue does not seem important enough for Apple to warrant a
fix. Knowing myself, I will keep trying with every new release...
<p>
<h4><a name="21sep2011">Update September 21, 2011:</a></h4>
<p>
Although I haven't yet upgraded to Lion myself, I've now received two
reports that Apple's latest offering actually fixes their bug.  Note
that, as stated in the initial writeup, a lack of errors reported from
the test procedure does not conclusively prove the operation is now
atomic, the chance of running into this issue under normal conditions
is at least greatly decreased.
<p>
So, it took them 3 years, but aparently it was worth the wait.  Thanks
to Apple for (finally) resolving the issue and thanks to Job and Ben
for reporting their results from their Lion machines.  Let's close
this chapter now :)
