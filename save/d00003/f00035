</p><p>
Free software is about sharing code and thus to help others.  Why are
GNU hackers supposed to help others with their code but required to
reject help from others?  Is this what free software is about?  I
doubt it.
</p><p>
Those questions arise due to a GNU policy of requiring copyright
assignments for some of the GNU software.  There are no clear rules
which software needs to have these legal paper exchange, but at
most of the early GNU software does (Emacs, gcc, libc, coreutils,
guile).
</p><p>
The official position of the FSF on the requirement of copyright
assignments is explained in a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html">short article</a> by Eben Moglen.  It is
commonly known that there are two main reasons why one should consider
to assign the copyright to a single trustworthy entity.
</p><p>
The first one is about legal security or whether it is possible to go
after and stop copyright violations.  Well, that is the theory.  My
experience with GnuPG and Libgcrypt seems to shown that the FSF does
not care too much about it.  For example, at least two companies in
Germany sold crypto mail gateways with OpenPGP support provided by
GnuPG; they did not released the source code or told the customers
about their rights.  The FSF didn’t acted upon my requests to stop
them violating their (assigned) copyright on GnuPG.  This is in
contrast to the <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/">FTF</a> as run by the
<abbr title="The Free Software Foundation Europe is independent of the FSF">
FSFE
</abbr>
and the <a href="http://gpl-violations.org">gpl-violations</a> group.  However, with the FSF holding the
copyright, the latter organization has no way to go after such
copyright infringements.
</p><p>
The second reason for copyright assignments is to be prepared for
future re-licensing.  This is actually the most compelling reason.
With distributed copyright it would be a lot of work and still often
impossible to change the license of a software — even if all
contributors would agree.  Exceptions like the recent <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/525718/">VLC re-licensing</a>
are quite rare.  A valid question is whether there is at all a need to
change a license.  Related to the GPL, I see two cases: The first case
is fortunately a minor problem because only a few projects are
affected by it: Upgrading from GPL version2 to version 3.  Usually
this is easy, because most GPL projects use the “or any later version”
option.  Those sticking to GPLv2only, like Linux or OpenVAS, are
really troubled and would either need to search the agreement of all
contributors or to rewrite the GPLv2only parts of the code.
</p><p>
The second case is about relaxing the conditions of the license, for
example from GPL to LGPL.  This might be justified for better general
interoperability or to help free software projects with GPL
incompatible licenses.  In the case of the GNU project such a change
is done quite seldom.  It would technically be easy to do this due to
their copyright assignment policy.  However, within the GNU project it
is more than hard to convince the FSF decision maker(s) that such a
change benefits the GNU project.  My impression is that to the FSF it
is far more important to protect the GNU project than the actual
freedom of helping others.  Something akin to: “Let us build a high
fence so we are free from proprietary software on our pasture.  Why
care about the lone hackers outside who don’t want to seek shelter
behind our fence.  After all only we are the good ones.”
</p><p>
Case in point: The GNU towers once declared <a href="http://gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/">Libgcrypt</a> to be the
standard GNU crypto library.  As a core GNU project it was clear that
we need to collect copyright assignments.  We even started with a
special copyright assignment to declare Libgcrypt as an independent
project from <a href="http://gnupg.org">GnuPG</a> (which is its origin).  So now we have a lot of
cipher algorithms were we are sure of the code provenience ---
i.e. everything has been assigned or disclaimed using a lot of snailed
paper.  The drawback of this policy is that we had to implement all
stuff by ourselves — despite that there was already a lot of highly
optimized LGPLed cipher code available.  We were simply not allowed to
use it.
</p><p>
Some years later <a href="http://gnu.org/software/nettle">Nettle</a> was put together as a collection of freely
available algorithms and some new glue stuff.  The author did not care
about copyright assignments and thus was able to use better optimized
code.  Nevertheless, Nettle was declared a GNU project and <a href="http://gnu.org/software/gnutls">GNUTLS</a>
(GNU’s answer to <a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg05393.html">Heathrow</a>^W <a href="http://openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>) eventually switched to Nettle due
to a 10% better performance figure in some areas.  The funny thing is
that GNUTLS itself requires copyright assignments.
</p><p>
Now why shall Libgcrypt require assignments if the GNU project does
not care about such dependencies?  A reason might be that Libgcrypt
provides a fallback in case there will ever be a legal problem with
Nettle.  I consider this a purely theoretical point because basically
both do the same and if suits wants to go after Nettle, I see no
reason why they should not also go after Libgcrypt.  Copyright is not
anymore the sharpest weapon they can use; patents and trademarks are
more dangerous than SCOing.
</p><p>
Back in April, I concluded that something needs to be done — at
least for Libgcrypt.  What I then did was pretty straightforward:
Libgcrypt now accepts contributions after having received a simple
mail (right, e-mail, no transatlantic snail mail) with a
<i>Developer’s Certificate of Origin</i> as known from other projects.
Voilà, patches with new features and performance improvements started
to come in.  Obviously, hackers who were afraid of the paper work or
assigning their work to an organization ailing on obstinacy of age,
gained interest in this GNU software and started to help out with
their experience and time.  I really like this outcome; let’s hope it
lasts.
</p><p>
Sure, other GNU projects with assignment policy are not anymore able
to freely copy and paste code from Libgcrypt.  But well, they won’t be
able to that with Nettle code either.  For the sake of the greater
free software community I consider this a minor disadvantage compared
to Libgcrypt vegging out as a too closed GNU project.
