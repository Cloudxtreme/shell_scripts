<h3>HISTORIC ISSUE/PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>

   The old central PennNet Authentication System (PAS) was used by a
   large and growing number of the network services available to the
   Penn community. But PAS had many shortcomings. It authenticated
   users by verifying reusable passwords that were transmitted over
   the network in the clear, which made it vulnerable to various forms
   of eavesdropping and password-guessing. It relied on custom network
   protocols designed at Penn, so any service that used PAS required
   non-standard software in order to authenticate users. It had no
   provisions for high availability. And it lacked Single Sign-on 
   functionality that would make authentication easier and more convenient 
   for users.

<h3>DIRECTION</h3>

   The new Central Authentication System deployed at Penn is called
   "PennKey" and is based on Kerberos.
<p>
   Kerberos is a standards-based central authentication system that 
   employs symmetric key cryptrography. The authentication function
   is mediated by a set of trusted servers on the network called Key 
   Distribution Centers (KDCs). The system provides mutual authentication, 
   in which both parties in the communication (clients and servers) 
   are authenticated to each other. It also provides facilities for 
   session encryption and integrity protection. Kerberos prevents the 
   transmission of user passwords over the network (in the clear or 
   even encrypted). Passwords are only used to encrypt and decrypt 
   time-limited cryptographic credentials which are subsequently used 
   in the authentication function. A special service called the "ticket 
   granting service" provides a much desired Single Sign-on capability.
<p>
   The core Kerberos infrastructure consists of multiple (currently three)
   redundant Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) that provide the Kerberos 
   authentication, ticket-granting and administration services. Each
   KDC is located in a distinct building on a distinct network (IP
   subnet) with redundant connectivity to the campus routing core via 
   distinct routing equipment. The Kerberos protocol supports multiple
   servers and transparently fails over to alternate servers. This
   design provides a high availability central authentication service 
   that is resistant to a wide variety of server and network failures, 
   and even environmental disasters. All KDC server platforms are 
   maximally secured against intrusion, even at the cost of making 
   routine systems administration more difficult (eg. by limiting 
   physical access to the server hardware and disallowing all unnecessary 
   network services, including remote logins.) Sensitive KDC data does 
   not appear on backup tapes in an unencrypted form, and any encryption
   keys required for backups are stored in physically secure facilities 
   for disaster recovery purposes.
<p>
   Additional software infrastructure provides convenient and secure
   facilities for online user account management and server principal
   and key management. A test Kerberos infrastructure provides facilities
   for Kerberos administrators to test new KDC software functionality.
   A RADIUS authentication service is also available to allow Kerberos
   password verification for applications that don't currently support
   native Kerberos authentication. In this scheme the application 
   transmits the users Kerberos password in a cryptographically secure 
   manner to a RADIUS service which subsequently authenticates the user 
   to the Kerberos service. It is meant as a transitional mechanism
   only until the application can support the Kerberos protocol directly.

<h3>PROGRESS SO FAR</h3>

   The core Kerberos infrastructure has been operational since the
   spring of 2000. The PAS service was retired in October 2002.
   Old PAS-authenticated services have either been transitioned
   to Kerberos authentication or re-architected to use the RADIUS
   service for Kerberos password verification as an interim step
   to direct use of Kerberos.

<h3>FUTURE PLANS</h3>

   Milestones remaining to be completed include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate Two-factor authentication systems for increased
       security (combining Kerberos passwords with hardware tokens
       for pre-authentication.) Due to issues of cost, this functionality 
       will most likely initially be considered for Kerberos system
       administrators only.
<li>Implement a multi-master Kerberos Administration service (KADM).
<li>Allow use of strong encryption key types only
    (3DES/RC4 128/AES 128/AES 256.) 
<li>Find native Kerberos authenticated solutions for some popular
       protocols: HTTP, 802.1X/EAP etc
<li>Long-term migration of all clients from simple password verification
       via RADIUS to single-sign-on via Kerberos.
<li>Retire legacy RADIUS password verification service.
<li>Design and deploy Kerberos authenticated services for
       Central Authorization and Accounting.
</ul>
