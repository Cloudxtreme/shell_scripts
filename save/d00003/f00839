<blockquote> 
  <p>1. <a href="#5_1">The Call states that Nominees will begin their terms at 
    the close of the board meeting in Cape Town. Does this mean that they must 
    be present at that meeting? Wouldn't that be a waste? That is, they will be 
    doing nothing productive and when all the business is done, they will officially 
    be seated.</a><br>
    2. <a href="#5_2">Who decides how a country should be included in a particular 
    Geographic Region?</a></p>

  <!-- 1 -->
  <li><a name="1_1"></a><b>What is the composition of the Nominating Committee?</b><br>
    Article VII, Section 2 of the Bylaws provides that the Nominating Committee 
    shall be composed of the following persons: 
    <ol>
      <!-- 2 -->
      <li>A non-voting Chair, appointed by the ICANN Board;</li>
      <li>The immediately previous Nominating Committee Chair, as a non-voting 
        advisor;</li>
      <li>A non-voting liaison appointed by the ICANN Root Server System Advisory 
        Committee established by Article XI of these Bylaws;</li>
      <li>A non-voting liaison appointed by the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory 
        Committee established by Article XI of these Bylaws;</li>
      <li>A non-voting liaison appointed by the Governmental Advisory Committee;</li>
      <li> Subject to the provisions of the Transition Article of these Bylaws, 
        five voting delegates selected by the At-Large Advisory Committee established 
        by Article XI of these Bylaws;</li>
      <li> Two voting delegates, one representing small business users and one 
        representing large business users, selected by the Business Users Constituency 
        of the Generic Names Supporting Organization established by Article X 
        of these Bylaws;</li>
      <li> One voting delegate each selected by the following entities: 
        <ol type="a">
          <!-- 3 -->
          <li>The gTLD Registry Constituency of the Generic Names Supporting Organization 
            established by Article X of these Bylaws;</li>
          <li>The gTLD Registrars Constituency of the Generic Names Supporting 
            Organization established by Article X of these Bylaws;</li>

          <li> The Council of the Address Supporting Organization established 
            by Article VIII of these Bylaws;</li>
          <li> An entity designated by the Board to represent academic and similar 
            organizations;</li>
          <li> Consumer and civil society groups, selected by the Non-commercial 
            Users Constituency of the Generic Names Supporting Organization established 
            by Article X of these Bylaws; </li>
          <li> The Internet Engineering Task Force; and </li>
          <li> The ICANN Technical Liaison Group established by Article XI-A of 
            these Bylaws; and </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- /3 -->
      <li> A non-voting Associate Chair, who may be appointed by the Chair, at 
        his or her sole discretion, to serve during all or part of the term of

        member of the same Nominating Committee. The Associate Chair shall assist 
        the Chair in carrying out the duties of the Chair, but shall not serve, 
        temporarily or otherwise, in the place of the Chair.</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- /2 -->
  </li>
  <li> <b><a name="1_2"></a>What are the criteria for delegates and liaisons to 
    the Nominating Committee?</b><br>
    Article VII, Section 4 of the Bylaws states that Delegates to the ICANN Nominating 
    Committee shall be: 
    <ol>
      <!-- 2 -->
      <li> Accomplished persons of integrity, objectivity, and intelligence, with 
        reputations for sound judgment and open minds, and with experience and 
        competence with collegial large group decision-making </li>
      <li> Persons with wide contacts, broad experience in the Internet community, 
        and a commitment to the success of ICANN; </li>
      <li> Persons whom the selecting body is confident will consult widely and 
        accept input in carrying out their responsibilities; </li>
      <li> Persons who are neutral and objective, without any fixed personal commitments 
        to particular individuals, organizations, or commercial objectives in 
        carrying out their Nominating Committee responsibilities; </li>
      <li> Persons with an understanding of ICANN's mission and the potential 
        impact of ICANN's activities on the broader Internet community who are 
        willing to serve as volunteers, without compensation other than the reimbursement 
        of certain expenses; and </li>
      <li> Persons who are able to work and communicate in written and spoken 
        English. </li>
    </ol>
    <!-- /2 -->
  </li>
  <li> <b> <a name="1_3"></a>Does the neutrality and objectivity requirement in 
    Criterion 4 mean that the delegate or liaison chosen by a constituency or 
    group cannot work for or be a member of the constituency or group? </b><br>
    NomCom works via group decision, through the development of consensus by delegates 
    and liaisons from all constituencies. Criterion 4 addresses how the person 
    selected is expected to behave, not who employs him/her. Those involved in 
    selecting delegates and liaisons may judge that the only way for a delegate 
    or liaison to achieve the desired independence is by restricting employment/consultant 
    status, but that restriction is not required by ICANN. The NomCom takes very 
    seriously its responsibilities to require NomCom members to disclose actual 
    and perceived conflicts of interest. See the posted 2003 Code of Ethics, and 
    the Charge to the Subcommittee on Conflicts of Interest at <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/"> 
    &lt;http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/&gt;</a>. </li>
  <li><b><a name="1_4"></a>What is expected of a Nominating Committee member?</b><br>
    NomCom members are expected to: 
    <ul>
      <li> engage in affirmative outreach and recruitment of excellent candidates 
      </li>
      <li> read the submitted and gathered information about each candidate under 
        consideration </li>
      <li> participate in NomCom teleconferences </li>
      <li> work diligently with NomCom colleagues toward an overall consensus 
        on the best possible group of candidates to be selected </li>
      <li> adhere to the Code of Ethics </li>
      <li>attend a face-to-face meeting (expected to be held in August-September)</li>
    </ul>
    Given the recruitment nature of NomCom's work, it will be particularly helpful 
    if members have extensive personal networks of contacts from outside, and 
    within ICANN, that will support effective recruiting. Furthermore it will 
    be valuable for such delegates to also be prepared to develop cross-constituency 
    understanding to build consensus. </li>
  <li><b><a name="1_5"></a>What is the role of the Nominating Committee in the 
    ICANN structure?</b><br>
    <p> Introduced as part of the 2002 ICANN reform process, the Nominating Committee 
      (NomCom) is responsible for selecting accomplished individuals to serve 
      in key leadership positions within the ICANN structure; including all ICANN 
      Directors except the President and those Directors selected by ICANN's Supporting 
      Organizations, and for such other selections as are set forth in the Bylaws. 
      Currently, these 'other selections' are for the GNSO Council, the ccNSO 
      Council, and the Interim At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC). </p>
    <p> In making its selections, the NomCom has explicit responsibilities in 
      support of ICANN's CoreValue 4 in Article I, Section 2 of the Bylaws: </p>
    Seeking and supporting broad, informed participation reflecting the functional, 
    geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at all policy development 
    and decision-making. 
    <p> The NomCom functions independently from the ICANN Board, Supporting Organizations, 
      and Advisory Committees. NomCom's selections are final.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><a name="1_6"></a>What positions and terms will be filled by the 2004 
    Nominating Committee?</b><br>
    <table>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><b> <a name="1_7"></a>What is the purpose of having the Nominating Committee 
    select these positions?</b><br>
    <p>A central rationale for using a Nominating Committee to select a portion 
      of the ICANN leadership bodies is to balance the other representation-based 
      selection of Directors and council and committee members with a selection 
      of those who will place the broad public interest ahead of any particular 
      interests, and who are nevertheless knowledgeable about ICANN, its communities 
      and responsibilities.</p>
    <p>To achieve this broad public-interest orientation, the membership of the 
      Nominating Committee is drawn from across the ICANN and global Internet 
      communities, on the theory that a Nominating Committee consisting of independent 
      delegates of widely varying backgrounds and interests will, by the imperative 
      of consensus, be able to produce slates of outstanding, highly-qualified, 
      well-respected, and diverse nominees.</p>
    <P>Nominating Committee members, although chosen from various constituencies 
      within ICANN, act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet 
      community, and within the scope of the ICANN mission and responsibilities 
      assigned to it by the ICANN Bylaws. They carry no personal commitments to 
      particular individuals, organizations, or commercial objectives. Thus, although 
      appointed by Supporting Organizations and other ICANN entities, Nominating 
      Committee members act as individuals and are not beholden to their appointing 
      constituencies. NomCom Members are, however, accountable for adherence to 
      the Bylaws and for compliance with the rules and procedures established 
      by the Nominating Committee.</P>
  </li>
  <li><b> <a name="1_8"></a>Once we have made our selection(s), who do we inform?</b><br>
    <p>Please email the name, biography and contact details of your NomCom delegate 
      to ICANN Secretary John Jeffrey at nomcom-selections@icann.org on or before 
      00:00 GMT 11 May 2004.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b> <a name="1_9"></a>Is the appointed liaison/delegate required to be a 
    member of the constituency/advisory committee that makes the appointment?</b><br>
    <p>No, the Bylaws have no requirement in this regard. Appointed delegates 
      and liaisons must meet only the criteria listed in the Bylaws. See also 
      the responses to Questions 2 and 3, above.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b> <a name="1_10"></a>Where will the face-to-face meetings be held?</b><br>
    <p> The Nominating Committee expects to hold a face-to-face meeting during 
      the ICANN meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in July. An additional meeting 
      may be held in August-September at a location to be determined by the geographical 
      composition of the NomCom. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <b><a name="1_11"></a>If a potential delegate/liaison cannot travel to 
    a face-to-face meeting is that a criterion for not selecting him/her?</b><br>
    <p> No, this is not a criterion listed in the Bylaws. However, please note 
      that NomCom relies on group decision making and building consensus to accomplish 
      its work. Ideally, all delegates and liaisons would be able to attend such 
      meetings. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="1_12"></a><b> Will there be funding available for travel to the 
    face-to-face meetings?</b><br>
    <p> Yes. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b> <a name="1_13"></a>How much time should NomCom members expect to allot 
    to NomCom activities?</b><br>
    <p> NomCom members are expected to be able to allot adequate time to read 
      all materials and participate in regular conference calls. Additionally, 
      NomCom members are expected to actively engage in individual recruitment 
      activities, which may take variable amounts of time. NomCom members are 
      expected to bring with them extensive personal networks from which to recruit 
      highly qualified candidates--last year each NomCom member was expected to 
      generate a minimum of 5 Statements of Interest. See also the response to 
      Question 4 above. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="1_14"></a><b> Will NomCom members be expected to abide by a Code 
    of Ethics?</b><br>
    <p> Yes. The Code of Ethics committed to by the 2003 NomCom can be found <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/procedures-10apr03.htm#A">here</a>.

<p><strong><a name="part2"></a>II. About Recommendations and Statements of Interest</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong><a name="2_1"></a>I received a notice saying that I had been recommended 
    to the Nominating Committee. How do I find out who recommended me? </p></strong> 
    <p>Under the NomCom&#8217;s <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/ethics-2004.html">Code 
      of Ethics</a>, all recommendations and statements of interest are treated 
      as confidential. 
    <p>The Nominating Committee encourages, but does not require, persons submitting 
      a Recommendation to contact the person recommended to inform him or her 
      of the recommendation, the position(s) for which the person is recommended, 
      and the reason for the recommendation.</p>
    <p>Recommendations are sought for the purpose of broadening the candidate 
      pool. Only those individuals who have submitted a complete Statement of 
      Interest will be considered Candidates for selection. How many recommendations 
      a Candidate may have received, or who may have recommended a Candidate, 
      are not influential factors in the selection process. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_2"></a>I received a notice saying that I had been recommended 
    to the Nominating Committee. How do I tell which position I was recommended 
    for?</strong> 
    <p>The Nominating Committee encourages, but does not require, persons submitting 
      a Recommendation to contact the person recommended to inform him or her 
      of the recommendation, the position(s) for which the person is recommended, 
      and the reason for the recommendation.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in serving but unsure of which role would be best 
      suited to your qualifications, please see the descriptions of the various 
      positions available in <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/formalcall-30jun04.htm#PositionRolesEligibilityFactorsandTimeCommitments">Section 
      E of the Formal Call</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_3"></a>Who will decide if my Statement of Interest is 
    complete? </strong> 
    <p>If no information is supplied in response to one or more of the *required* 
      items in your Statement of Interest, you will not be considered a Candidate 
      for Selection. To the extent that NomCom has the time and capacity to do 
      so, it will attempt to notify you to give you an opportunity to provide 
      the missing information, but the responsibility rests with you to submit 
      a complete Statement of Interest before 25 August 2004 (12:00 GMT). </p>
    <p>In the course of its review and evaluation of submitted Statements of Interest, 
      NomCom may find that it needs clarification or amplification of the content 
      of your submission. In that case, NomCom will attempt to reach you to obtain 
      additional information.</p>
    <p>The limited time available for this process means that potential Candidates 
      are best served by carefully preparing their Statements of Interest, ensuring 
      that they are complete, and submitting them as soon as possible. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_4"></a>Please tell me who can recommend someone. In your 
    formal call, there is no mention about the "recommender". Can anybody (individual, 
    employees, officials, company, organization etc.) be a recommender? </strong> 
    <p>Recommendations can be made by anyone. NomCom has imposed no restrictions 
      as to who can make recommendations. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_5"></a>What should a Recommendation of a potential candidate 
    include? </strong> 
    <p>All that is required is the name and e-mail address of the person recommended 
      and your name and e-mail address. This information should be submitted to 
      &lt;<a href="mailto:nomcom-submissions@icann.org">nomcom-submissions@icann.org</a>&gt;.</p>
    <p>The NomCom Coordinator will acknowledge receipt of the Recommendation and 
      encourage the Recommender to liaise with the potential candidate to encourage 
      him/her to submit a Statement of Interest. The NomCom Coordinator will also 
      contact the potential candidate(s) directly to tell them they have been 
      recommended and to provide to them the instructions and the form for submitting 
      the Statement of Interest.</p>
    <p>The Nominating Committee encourages those submitting a Recommendation to 
      contact the person recommended to inform him or her of the recommendation, 
      the position(s) for which the person is recommended, and the reason for 
      the recommendation. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_6"></a>Is submitting more than one Recommendation acceptable? 
    </strong> 
    <p>Yes. Since the Nominating Committee is charged with filling multiple positions 
      which have varying roles within ICANN, you might well know more than one 
      individual worthy of your Recommendation.</p>
    <p>The NomCom places great emphasis on developing a Candidate pool of high 
      quality. We are much less concerned about the size of the Candidate pool 
      provided it is large enough to offer multiple well-qualified Candidates 
      for each position.</p>
    <p>Therefore we urge you to think deeply about who you feel would be most 
      suitable to serve and then submit only those names to NomCom. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_7"></a>I'm thinking of submitting a Statement of Interest. 
    Do I need to have a Recommendation to be considered a Candidate? </strong> 
    <p>No. For you to be considered by the NomCom as a Candidate, you only need 
      to ensure that you have answered all the required items in the Statement 
      of Interest. Your Statement of Interest must be received by the NomCom no 
      later than 12:00 GMT on 25 August 2004 in order for you to receive full 
      consideration.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_8"></a>Will having a Recommendation benefit my Candidacy 
    in any way? </strong> 
    <p>No, Recommendations do not influence the priority of individual candidacies, 
      but they are important for the success of the NomCom Candidate recruiting 
      process.</p>
    <p>The NomCom is using Recommendations to enhance the Candidate pool from 
      which we will make our selections. As you know, we are seeking those individuals 
      who have demonstrated the maturity, experience, knowledge and skills to 
      handle the tasks and make the judgments involved in fulfilling the roles 
      of Board Directors, Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) Council 
      Members, Interim At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) Members, and Country 
      Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) Council Members.</p>
    <p>Those who provide Recommendations to the NomCom strengthen our recruiting 
      outreach, encourage potential candidates to participate, and address cultural 
      and professional differences in perceptions about appropriate ways to participate 
      in a candidate search process.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we ask those who make Recommendations to actively encourage 
      their Recommendee(s) to submit a Statement of Interest. Only those Recommendees 
      who submit a completed Statement of Interest will be considered by NomCom. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="2_9"></a><strong>I have a detailed resume/CV. Should I attach this 
    as part of my Statement of Interest? </strong> 
    <p>No. A resume or curriculum vitae (CV) is not required by the NomCom and 
      should not be attached to Statement of Interest when submitted.</p>
    <p>We ask that you carefully consider all the required items in your Statement 
      of Interest and provide your answers to all of them, in English.</p>
    <p>Insofar as the information requested in the Statement of Interest is already 
      documented in your resume/CV, you are welcome to copy those parts of your 
      resume/CV into your Statement of Interest at the appropriate places in the 
      Statement. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="2_10"></a>I would like to receive the latest developments 
    and announcements from the NomCom. What should I do?</strong> 
    <p>The NomCom posts its latest developments to its announcement mailing list 
      and to <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/">its web page</a>. 
      If you would like to automatically receive these announcements, please send

  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="2_11"></a>When is the deadline to submit my Statement 
      of Interest?</strong> </p>
    <p>The deadline has been extended. Your Statement of Interest must be received 
      by the NomCom no later than 12:00 GMT on 25 of August 2004 in order for 
      you to receive full consideration. We encourage you to send completed Statement 
      of Interest as early as possible.</p>

<p><strong><a name="part3"></a>III. Deciding on Whether to Become a Candidate</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="3_1"></a> 
    <p><strong>Why should anyone consider serving in one of these positions?</strong></p>
    <p>The ICANN Board, the GNSO Council, Interim At-Large Advisory Committee, 
      and ccNSO Council, each in its own way, plays a leadership role in ICANN's 
      significant but focused set of responsibilities with respect to the global 
      Internet's stable and secure operation.</p>
    <p>[The <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/formalcall-30jun04.htm">Formal Call</a> 
      describes ICANN's Mission and the roles of the Members of each of these 
      bodies. See <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/formalcall-30jun04.htm#PositionRolesEligibilityFactorsandTimeCommitments">Section E</a>.]</p>
    <p>Those who serve in these positions will work with accomplished colleagues 
      from around the globe. They will address intriguing technical coordination 
      problems and related policy development challenges with diverse functional, 
      cultural, and geographic dimensions. They will gain valuable insights and 
      experience from working across these boundaries of knowledge, responsibility, 
      and perspective.</p>
    <p>Those selected by NomCom to serve in these positions will gain the satisfaction 
      of making a valuable public service contribution. Placing the broad public 
      interest ahead of any particular interests, they will help ensure the stability 
      and security of this valuable global resource for critically important societal 
      functions.</p>
    <p>They will be challenged to use their knowledge, experience, and open-mindedness 
      to develop creative responses to the dilemmas that arise when diverse needs 
      of Internet users, technical possibilities and limitations of the Internet's 
      unique identifier systems, and challenges and opportunities of the competitive 
      business environment interact with each other and with evolving laws and 
      governmental policies.</p>
    <p>The agenda for the next two to three years includes an array of interesting 
      and important matters, both technical (such as security, Internationalized 
      Domain Names, and IPv6). and organizational (such as the evolution of relationships 
      with the Regional Internet Registries, the country-code top-level domain 
      constituencies, the root server operators, and the development of the Regional 
      At-Large Organizations.)</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_2"></a>My first language is not English. Will this affect 
      my Candidacy?</strong></p>
    <p>No, as long as you are able both to work well and communicate well in written 
      and spoken English. There is no requirement that English must be your first 
      language.</p>
    <p>The NomCom welcomes and encourages participation from all members from 
      wider Internet community, from all over the world. There is no reason, therefore, 
      to expect that your first language is English. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="3_3"></a> 
    <p><strong>What is the expected time commitment needed to serve on the Board 
      of Directors?</strong></p>
    <p>The basic responsibilities of an ICANN Director require a commitment of 
      time roughly equivalent to a full day every two weeks, exclusive of any 
      work on Board Committees. The time spent in these basic responsibilities 
      is typically clustered around Board meetings and teleconferences.</p>
    <p>Directors spend additional time in connection with their work on Board 
      Committees, a commitment which varies in relation to the number of Committees 
      on which they serve, the scope of the Committee's responsibilities, and 
      their role as Chairman or Member of the Committee.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_4"></a>What is the expected time commitment needed to 
      serve on the GNSO Council?</strong></p>
    <p>An average GNSO Council member would spend at least 12 hours per month 
      on Council related activities, with those chairing committees or task forces 
      spending at least 50 hours a month. (The commitment involves a minimum of 
      6 hours per month based on an average of 1.5 two-hour teleconferences (or 
      physical meetings) per month plus about two hours of preparation for each 
      meeting for reading task force reports and potentially discussing with the 
      community. Participation in committees of the council and/or task forces 
      could easily double that minimum time commitment.)</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_5"></a>What is the expected time commitment needed to 
      serve on the Interim ALAC?</strong></p>
    <p>Approximately 7 hours per week is required of members of Interim ALAC member 
      to fulfill their duties in this role. This includes participating in online 
      (e-mail) discussions, commenting on/contributing to documents/proposed actions 
      (drafted in English), participating in monthly ALAC telephone conferences 
      (in English), and meeting with/making presentations to, local and regional 
      organizations.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_6"></a>What is the expected time commitment needed to 
      serve on the ccNSO Council?</strong></p>
    <p>An average ccNSO Council member would spend at least 12 hours per month 
      on Council related activities, with those chairing committees or task forces 
      spending at least 50 hours a month. (The commitment involves a minimum of 
      6 hours per month based on an average of 1.5 two-hour teleconferences (or 
      physical meetings) per month plus about two hours of preparation for each 
      meeting for reading task force reports and potentially discussing with the 
      community. Participation in committees of the council and/or task forces 
      could easily double that minimum time commitment.)</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="3_7"></a> 
    <p><strong>What does it mean that the positions are "Voluntary"?</strong></p>
    <p>ICANN Directors, GNSO Council Members, Interim ALAC Members, and ccNSO 
      Council Members shall receive no compensation for their services in these 
      positions. </p>
    <p>Travel to the ICANN face to face meetings will be reimbursed for Directors, 
      and for those GNSO Council members, ccNSO Council members, and Interim ALAC 
      members that were selected and appointed by the NomCom process. </p>
    <p>ICANN's work benefits from an enormous amount of volunteered effort on 
      the part of many individuals who serve without compensation. These contributions 
      are respected and appreciated.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_8"></a>If I am selected by the NomCom, will I be paid 
      for my time?</strong></p>
    <p>No, ICANN Directors, GNSO Council Members, Interim ALAC Members, and ccNSO 
      Council Members receive no compensation for their services. ICANN respects 
      the generous contribution of time, energy and effort made by those who serve 
      in these positions. [See Question 7 above, "What does it mean that the positions 
      are 'Voluntary'?"]</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_9"></a>Can you please clarify whether I can apply for 
      all of the available positions for Director, GNSO Council, Interim ALAC, 
      and ccNSO Council, or whether I need to specify one position only at the 
      outset?</strong></p>
    <p>You can indicate your interest in serving all four types of positions by 
      marking all four spaces in item (f) in your Statement of Interest.</p>
    <p>Please mark all the positions for which you are interested in being considered 
      and in which you would be willing to serve if selected by NomCom.</p>
    <p>[Note: The NomCom may contact you later if it would like to consider you 
      for a position that you have not marked, but NomCom is working on a very 
      tight schedule. Your carefully considered response to this question now 
      will facilitate NomCom's deliberations.]</p>

    <p><strong>Where are the ICANN meetings held?</strong></p>
    <p>ICANN meetings are held regularly in different parts of the world. A calendar 
      of events is <a href="/meetings/">posted on the ICANN Website</a>. </p>
    <p>For 2004, the ICANN meetings are as follows:</p>
    <p>March 2004 Rome (Italy) <br>
      June 2004 Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) <br>
      December 2004 Cape Town (South Africa) </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="3_11"></a>How many ICANN meetings are there in one year?</strong></p>
    <p>ICANN generally has 3 meetings per year.</p>
    <p>Note that much of the work of the ICANN Board, GNSO Council, Interim ALAC, 
      and ccNSO Council is done via e-mail and teleconference.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><a name="3_12"></a>How are ICANN Directors, GNSO Council members, ALAC 
      members, and ccNSO Council members protected from liabilities arising from 
      their service on these groups? Are they indemnified by ICANN? Is there liability 
      insurance?</p>
    <p>ICANN Directors, GNSO Council members, ALAC members, and ccNSO Council 
      members enjoy several types of protection from liability for their activities 
      in service to ICANN. These may be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p>(a) Indemnification by ICANN. Under its bylaws, ICANN indemnifies members 
      of ICANN bodies against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other 
      amounts that actually and reasonably arise in a proceeding because those 
      persons are acting or have acted as agents of ICANN. There are various conditions 
      to this indemnity, including that the indemnified person's acts were in 
      good faith and done in a manner reasonably believed to be in ICANN's best 
      interests and not criminal. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XIV">Bylaws 
      Article XIV</a>]</p>
    <p>(b) Insurance. ICANN carries insurance covering liabilities (including 
      defense expenses) that ICANN and its Directors, volunteers, and committee 
      members may incur by reason of acts or omissions solely in their capacities 
      as Directors, volunteers, and committee members acting on behalf of ICANN. 
      The insurance policy includes deductibles, exclusions, and conditions that 
      are ordinary in a liability policy covering directors, officers, and volunteers 
      of a non-profit corporation.</p>
    <p>(c) Statutory Immunity. United States federal law and California law contain 
      provisions shielding volunteers to non-profit organizations (such as ICANN) 
      from liabilities for their volunteer work, with some conditions. The U.S. 
      Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 protects volunteers (i.e. those serving 
      without compensation) to non-profit organizations from liability for harm 
      caused by their acts and omissions while acting within the scope of their 
      responsibilities in the organization and not in a willful, criminal, grossly 
      negligent, reckless, etc. manner. [<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/42/chapters/139/toc.html">42 
      United States Code §§14501-14505</a>] California law provides similar liability 
      protections to volunteer directors. [<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/corp/5230-5239.html">California 
      Corporations Code § 5239</a>]</p>
    <p>Although there are various conditions and limits on each type of protection, 
      in the aggregate these protections provide significant protection to ICANN 
      volunteers acting in good faith and in the scope of their responsibilities 
      to ICANN.</p>

    <p><strong><a name="3_13"></a>I'm considering serving on the GNSO Council/Interim 
      ALAC/ccNSO Council but don't have the funds to travel to the regular ICANN 
      meetings. Will funds be provided by ICANN for such travel?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. ICANN will pay for NomCom appointees to the GNSO Council, Interim 
      ALAC, and ccNSO Council to attend the ICANN face-to-face meetings.</p>

<p><strong><a name="part4"></a>IV. Nominating Committee's Role</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p><strong><a name="4_1"></a>In 2000 some ICANN board members were chosen 
      by an online vote of Internet users. Do I understand correctly that selections 
      made by the NomCom are final and no election will be held?</strong></p>
    <p>You understand correctly. The selections by the Nominating Committee are 
      final, and no vote or ratification by Internet users (or by the ICANN Board) 
      will be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="4_2"></a> 
    <p><strong>What led to the NomCom making the final selections so that they 
      need no further ratification or approval?</strong></p>
    <p>In 2002, ICANN underwent a reformation process involving extensive discussions 
      throughout the ICANN community. The overall structure that came out of this 
      process is described in <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/evol-reform/blueprint-20jun02.htm">ICANN: 
      Blueprint for Reform</a> (posted 20 June 2002) and the <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/evol-reform/final-implementation-report-02oct02.htm">Final 
      Implementation and Recommendations of the Committee on ICANN Evolution and 
      Reform</a> (posted 2 October 2002). These documents called for formation 
      of a Nominating Committee to select individuals to serve on key ICANN bodies. 
      The latter report included the proposed Bylaws for implementing the recommendations. 
      The <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-15dec02.htm">Bylaws that were 
      approved at the Amsterdam ICANN meeting on 15 December 2002</a> assign to 
      the Nominating Committee the responsibility for selections of all ICANN 
      Directors except the President and those Directors selected by ICANN's Supporting 
      Organizations, and for such other selections as are set forth in the Bylaws. 
      [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1">Article VII, Section 
      1</a>]</p>
    <p>The Nominating Committee's responsibility for selection of three members 
      of the GNSO Council is set forth in <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#X-3">Article 
      X, Section 3, paragraphs 1, 2, and 3</a>.</p>
    <p>The Nominating Committee's responsibility for selecting five members of 
      the Interim At-Large Advisory Committee is set forth in <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XI-2.4">Article 
      XI, Section 2, paragraph 4</a>.</p>
    <p>The Nominating Committee's responsibility for selecting three members of 
      the ccNSO Council is set forth in Article IX, Section 3, paragraph 1(b).</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XX">Transition Article, 
      Article XX</a>, sets forth additional details of the Nominating Committee's 
      role in relation to the transition to the new ICANN structure. <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm">Technical 
      revisions for clarification of a few parts of the Bylaws</a> were approved 
      and became effective as of 25 March 2003, but these changes did not modify 
      the basic role of the Nominating Committee.</p>

    <p><strong><a name="5_1"></a>The Call states that Nominees will be seated 
      at the close of the board meeting in Cape Town. Does this mean that they 
      must be present at that meeting? Wouldn't that be a waste? That is, they 
      will be doing nothing productive and when all the business is done, they 
      will officially be seated.</strong></p>
    <p>It will be extremely valuable for the Nominees to the New Board to be present 
      during the Cape Town meeting. They will learn a great deal by their presence 
      at the meeting, and the overlap prior to taking office will afford invaluable 
      communication with outgoing members of the given leadership bodies. </p>
