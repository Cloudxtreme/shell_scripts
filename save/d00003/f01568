<b>UPDATE:</b> <i>This document is historical. In 2008, the University 
acquired a portable (Provider-Independent) IPv6 allocation from the 
regional registry, ARIN <b>2607:f470::/32</b>, and has developed
a new addressing plan, replacing the one described here.</i>
</p>

<a name="Intro">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

This document describes the preliminary IPv6 addressing plan for PennNet,
the University of Pennsylvania's campus data network.

<p>

Penn's IPv6 address block is <b>2001:0468:1802::/48</b>, which is allocated 
by the MAGPI GigaPoP out of it's 2001:0468:1800::/40 space. The
MAGPI allocation in turn was received from it's provider, Abilene,
the Internet2 backbone network. The university is contemplating applying
for a portable allocation from ARIN to aid in future multi-homing.

<p>
In Penn's case, the structure of an IPv6 address looks like
the following (see RFC 3513):

<pre>
    |         48 bits         | 16   bits |       64 bits              |
    +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+
    | global routing prefix   | subnet ID |       interface ID         |
    +-------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+

</pre>

where the global routing prefix is 2001:0468:1802::

<p>

<a name="Scheme">
<h2>General Scheme</h2>

The University's /48 allocation is sufficient to number 65,536
(2 ** 16) /64 sized subnets. However, the first /64 prefix,
2001:0468:1802::/64 is treated specially.

<p>
Certain specialized subnets do not need to consume so much space, 
such as point to point links between routers, router only broadcast 
networks in the core of PennNet etc. For such networks, smaller 
subnet allocations of size /112 will be made from the first /64
prefix.
<p>
In addition, the first /112 sized prefix, 2001:0468:1802::/112,
is reserved for router loopback addresses and other host routes. 
The remaining 65,535 /64 prefixes will be employed for general 
campus subnets.

<h3>Router Loopback Addresses</h3>

Router loopback addresses are /128 bit host routes allocated in
the prefix 2001:0468:1802::/112. Some initial allocations are:

<pre>
        Address                                         Router

        2001:0468:1802:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001/128     external1
        2001:0468:1802:0000:0000:0000:0000:0002/128     external2

        2001:0468:1802:0000:0000:0000:0000:000d/128     
</pre>

<h3>Point-to-Points and other special networks</h3>

These networks typically comprise only router interfaces which
do not use EUI-64 style auto-configuration. Hence subnets smaller
than a /64 can be used. These networks are /112 sized allocations 
made in the prefix 2001:0468:1802::/96. Excluding the /112 allocation 
already reserved for router loopbacks, this provides the ability to
number 65,535 such networks.

<h3>Reserved ranges</h3>

The remaining space in 2001:0468:1802::/64 is reserved for future
use.

<h3>General campus subnets</h3>

General campus subnets are all /64 sized networks excluding
the first /64 prefix, ie.

</pre>

There is currently no general strategy of where in the range
a particular /64 subnet allocation will be made. Topological
assignment may not provide much benefit in terms of it's route
aggregation possibilities because end user subnets are increasingly
multihomed to the PennNet core.

<h3>Delegations to other departments</h3>

Large schools, institutes or departments that need their own
allocation will be provided a chunk of contiguous space from 
the allocation for general campus subnets. Examples include
the Engineering school (SEASnet) and Resnet. Typically, an 
aggregate advertisement for these spaces will be made at their 
points of attachment to the campus routing core.

<a name="Routing">
<h2>Routing Design</h2>

<b>Integrated IS-IS</b> is configured as the interior routing protocol 
for IPv6. It is configured to initially carry IPv6 routes only in order
to separate it from the production IPv4 network which runs OSPF version
2. At some point in the future, IS-IS will likely be employed to route 
IPv4 also. A single flat level-2 IS-IS area  is initially deployed. A 
multi area design will likely emerge with increased deployment of IPv6 
on campus.
<p>
<b>Multi-protocol BGP</b> is used for inter-domain peering with external
IPv6 networks. At the current time, Penn's sole IPv6 peer is the
MAGPI GigaPoP. Additionally, an IPv6 Internal-BGP mesh is configured 
between all the IPv6 enabled Penn core and border routers. 
<p>
Address configuration for endstations is performed via stateless 
address auto-configuration (RFC 2461). Stateful DHCPv6 service
may be deployed at a future date to centrally manage host address
assignments.

<a name="DNS">
<h2>DNS Configuration</h2>

The Penn DNS servers support AAAA and IPv6 (long) PTR records. One
of the authoritative servers (noc3.dccs.upenn.edu) currently supports
DNS queries over IPv6 transport. An initial set of IPv6 ranges and 
their associated DNS domain names have been configured in the DNS 
management application (Assignments). A new third level domain, 
<b>v6.upenn.edu</b>, has been created, for use by hosts that want 
to maintain a separate domain name for their IPv6 addresses.

<a name="Future">
<h2>Future Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Integrated IS-IS for both IPv4 and IPv6 interior routing
<li>IPv6 Multicast routing
<li>Stateful auto-configuration using DHCPv6
<li>Testing of IPv6 Enabled Applications
</ul>
