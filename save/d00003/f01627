<p>
The Dragon Research Group (DRG) Challenges are designed to help develop
security community expertise and bring practical security solutions to
fruition for the public benefit.  At select events our volunteers will
construct and coordinate hands-on information security challenges that
will inspire, educate and entertain attendees.  In addition to hands-on,
in-person events, the DRG also coordinates online challenges for the
greater information security community that is open to anyone with an
Internet connection, the interest and motivation to compete.  Where
possible, the DRG awards some prizes to winning contestants.  Prizes
vary by venue and challenge, but winners always receive heaps of praise
and public recognition for their achievement.
</p>

<p>
A public, moderated <a
href="https://dragonresearchgroup.org/mailman/listinfo/challenges">challenges
mailing list</a> has been setup to help support DRG challenges and
information security challenge-related discussion.  Join the discussion
today.

Quest</a></dt>
    <dd>"The USCC-sponsored Cyber Quests are a series of fun but
        challenging on-line competitions allowing participants to
        demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of information security
        realms. Each quest features an artifact for analysis, along with
        a series of quiz questions. Some quests focus on a potentially
        vulnerable sample web server as the artifact, challenging
        participants to identify its flaws using vulnerability analysis
        skills. Other quests are focused around forensic analysis,
        packet capture analysis, and more. The quests have varying
        levels of difficulty and complexity, with some quests geared
        toward beginners, while others include more intermediate and
        ultimately advanced material."</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.nationalccdc.org/">National Collegiate
      Defense Competition</a></dt>
    <dd>"CCDC competitions ask student teams to assume administrative
        and protective duties for an existing "commercial" network -
        typically a small company with 50+ users, 7 to 10 servers, and
        common Internet services such as a web server, mail server, and
        e-commerce site.  Each team begins the competition with an
        identical set of hardware and software and is scored on their
        ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain
        availability of existing services such as mail servers and web
        servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or
        removal of additional services, and balance security needs
        against business needs.  Throughout the competition an automated
        scoring engine is used to verify the functionality and
        availability of each teamâ€™s services on a periodic basis and
        traffic generators continuously feed simulated user traffic into
        the competition network.  A volunteer red team provides the
        'external threat' all Internet-based services face and allows
        the teams to match their defensive skills against live
        opponents."</dd>

      Challenge</a></dt>
    <dd>"The annual DC3 challenge is a call to the digital forensics
        community to pioneer new investigative tools, techniques, and
        methodologies. Players are challenged to complete a large array
        of scenario-driven progressive level challenges. The winning
        team receives an all expense paid trip to the DoD Cyber Crime
        Conference for community recognition.</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://www.honeynet.org/challenges/">Honeynet Project
      Challenges</a></dt>
    <dd>"The purpose of Honeynet Challenges is to take [... our findings
        ...] one step farther. Instead of having the Honeynet Project
        analyze attacks and share their findings, Challenges give the
        security community the opportunity to analyze these attacks and
        share their findings. The end results is not only do individuals
        and organizations learn about threats, but how to learn and
        analyze them. Even better, individuals can see the write-ups
        from other individuals, learning new tools and technique for
        analyzing attacks. Best of all, these attacks are from the wild,
        real hacks."</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://www.cfreds.nist.gov/">The CFReDS Project</a></dt>
    <dd>"NIST is developing Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets
        (CFReDS) for digital evidence. These reference data sets
        (CFReDS) provide to an investigator documented sets of simulated
        digital evidence for examination.  Since CFReDS would have
        documented contents, such as target search strings seeded in
        known locations of CFReDS, investigators could compare the
        results of searches for the target strings with the known
        placement of the strings. Investigators could use CFReDS in
        several ways including validating the software tools used in
        their investigations, equipment check out, training
        investigators, and proficiency testing of investigators as part
        of laboratory accreditation. The CFReDS site is a repository of
        images. Some images are produced by NIST, often from the CFTT
        (tool testing) project, and some are contributed by other
        organizations."</dd>
