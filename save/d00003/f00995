<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p>
       Network mobility support is necessary for groups of computers
       moving together and requiring access to the Internet, such as
       networks of sensors or access networks deployed in
       vehicles. NEMO Basic Support (or NEMO in short <a class="info" href="#RFC3963">[2]<span> (</span><span class="info">Devarapalli, V., Wakikawa, R., Petrescu, A., and P. Thubert, &ldquo;Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>) has been specified to address this need.
    
</p>
<p>In some situations, the mobile network may be multihomed, that
       is either when a mobile router is multihomed or when several
       mobile routers are being used to attach the same mobile network
       to the Internet <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-nemo-multihoming-issues">[5]<span> (</span><span class="info">Ng, C., Paik, E., Ernst, T., and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.  This brings a
       number of benefits <a class="info" href="#I-D.ernst-generic-goals-and-benefits">[6]<span> (</span><span class="info">Ernst, T., &ldquo;Goals and Benefits of Multihoming,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> including for
       instance the possibility to face the lack of coverage of a
       particular technology, to increase the Internet connectivity
       and to choose the best path in terms of delay, bandwidth or
       price.
    
</p>
<p>
       In theory, the simultaneous use of multiple Mobile Routers
       (MRs) improves the overall Internet connectivity offered to the
       Mobile Network Nodes (MNN) located in the mobile network,
       because multiple paths to the Internet are available.  However,
       in practice, it cannot be realized using NEMO basic support
       only. One of the reasons is that an MR in a mobile network does
       not know when another Internet connectivity (provided by
       another MR) is available.
    
</p>
<p>
       Some of the issues are outlined in <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-nemo-multihoming-issues">[5]<span> (</span><span class="info">Ng, C., Paik, E., Ernst, T., and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and cooperation
       between MRs is advocated, but we need to further detail the
       problem before we can bring a solution for such a cooperation
       between MRs.
    
</p>
<p>
       At first we describe in section <a class="info" href="#sec:objectives">Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class="info">Objectives, Motivations and Assumptions</span><span>)</span></a>
       the motivations and scenarios for using multiple MRs. Then, in
       <a class="info" href="#sec:failures">Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class="info">Points Of Failure</span><span>)</span></a> we detail the problems or
       limitations caused by the use of multiple MRs to connect a NEMO
       to the Internet. From this problem description, we are able to
       list a number of requirements in <a class="info" href="#sec:requirements">Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class="info">Requirements Analysis</span><span>)</span></a> and finally we discuss in <a class="info" href="#sec:approaches">Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class="info">Approaches</span><span>)</span></a> potential approaches for MR
       cooperation.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor2">2.1</a>&nbsp;Objectives</h4>

<p>The objectives of this document are:
     
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To analyze further the cases where multiple MRs are
          available in the NEMO (cases (n,*,*) as
          categorized in <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-nemo-multihoming-issues">[5]<span> (</span><span class="info">Ng, C., Paik, E., Ernst, T., and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>).
       
</li>
<li>To pave the way for a comprehensive solution to the issues
          applying to such a multihomed NEMO configuration.
       
</li>
<li>To clarify the MR cooperation issues and to list the required
          mechanisms for MR cooperation.

       
</li>
<li>To discuss possible approaches.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor3">2.2</a>&nbsp;Sample Scenarios</h4>

<a name="rfc.section.2.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor4">2.2.1</a>&nbsp;Mobile Network in a Personal Area Network</h4>

<p>In a Personal Area Network (PAN), both a mobile phone and a 
        PDA are acting as MRs and connecting the mobile network to 
	the Internet (<a class="info" href="#fig:pan_network">Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class="info">Mobile Network in a Personal Area Network</span><span>)</span></a>). The
        MRs have different access technologies. A GPRS interface is
        provided by the mobile phone, and an IEEE802.11g interface is
        shipped with the PDA. Some MNNs such as a portable game player
        and a small PC are connected to the PAN. These MNNs may communicate 
	with Correspondent Nodes (CN) with different needs in terms of cost, 
	efficiency, bandwidth requirement, delay, etc. For example, a 
	network game played on the portable game player may require less 
	delay and higher bandwidth than browsing on the PC. In this case, the 
	traffic of the network game could use IEEE802.11g access available 
	on the PDA, whereas the web access could use both GPRS and 
	IEEE802.11g. The use of multiple MRs simultaneously allows to 
	increase the bandwidth and to improve the access redundancy for the
	MNNs located in the mobile network. However, the current NEMO Basic 
	Support does not provide any solution to share the connectivities 
	among several MRs. We thus consider that there is a need for MRs 
	cooperation.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor5">2.2.2</a>&nbsp;Mobile Network in a Vehicle</h4>

<p>We are assuming network of sensors and computers deployed in
          vehicles as shown in <a class="info" href="#fig:vehicle_network">Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class="info">Mobile Network in a Vehicle</span><span>)</span></a>.
          There are several MNNs in a vehicle and the vehicle network
          is connected to the Internet via two in-vehicle MRs.  One is
          a powerful MR that provides high-bandwidth to the MNN.  As it
          may consume some energy, it is only switched on when the car
          is started. When the car is turned off, this MR is switched off.  
	  The other MR is a low-power, low-cost and low-bandwidth MR 
	  that is used as a backup while the vehicle is stopped (ie when 
	  the engine is off) or when the main MR sustains some failures. 
	  The use of multiple MRs allows to access anytime the sensible 
	  information of the car. Some cooperation between those MRs 
	  would allow to ensure that a path is always available from and 
	  to the MNNs.

          recovered via the other MR relaying the failed one. There are 
          thus more chances to maintain a permanent connectivity to the
          Internet.

          When several tunnels are available simultaneously, traffic
          can be spread among several MRs, either by sharing the
          communication flows between MRs, or bicasting (n-casting)
          packets. In addition, and provided enough information about
          the available paths and their characteristics (link
          efficiency, cost, etc), packets could be routed according to
          preferences set up by the users or the applications.

        Following the taxonomy proposed in <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-nemo-multihoming-issues">[5]<span> (</span><span class="info">Ng, C., Paik, E., Ernst, T., and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, we will
	concentrate the analysis taking into account all the

	NEMO. This includes all the (n,*,*) cases, namely:

<ol class="text">

</p>
<p>
       We assume that tunnels are set up using NEMO Basic Support and
       some extensions to support multiple binding registrations, as
       currently investigated by the Monami6 WG.  Three configurations
       can be divided when multiple MRs are connecting the same NEMO
       to the Internet, as shown in <a class="info" href="#fig:mr_binding_types">Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class="info">Tunnel Topology Type</span><span>)</span></a>. These MRs connecting the same NEMO are 
       referred to as "neighbor MRs" in some parts of the present document.
    
</p>
<p>In the (n,1,*) case, all (MR,HA) tunnels end up at the same
       HA. In the (n,n,*) case, either all (MR,HA) tunnels may end up
       at different HAs in a "pair tunnel" type or tunnels may be
       established between each MR and several HAs in "mesh like"
       type.

        There are four points of failure that may affect the way

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor7">3.1</a>&nbsp;MR Failure (B)</h4>

<p>
          The failure of the MR could happen when the MR is down or
          when it is isolated from the other MRs. (e.g. all interfaces
          are down). As a result, the failed MR becomes unreachable
          and thus unable to communicate with other MRs and HAs. All
          tunnels established by this MR would be disrupted (see point
          (B) on <a class="info" href="#fig:failure_analysis">Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class="info">Failure Analysis</span><span>)</span></a>). In
          addition, the failure may affect the MR which was
          advertising an MNP, which may cause some MNNs to
          renumber.
       
</p>
<p>
          A mechanism is needed to detect the failure of the MR and to
          redirect the traffic over an alternative tunnel (possibly
          newly established) between another MR and the same or
          another HA. It may also be necessary to relay the MNP that
          was advertised by the failed MR.

       
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor8">3.2</a>&nbsp;HA Failure (D)</h4>

<p>
        The failure of the HA could happen when the HA is down or when
        it is isolated from the Internet, for instance when the access
        network where the interface that connects it to the Internet
        fails or if the fault occurs at the edge of the network. As a
        result, the HA becomes unreachable (see point (D) on 
        <a class="info" href="#fig:failure_analysis">Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class="info">Failure Analysis</span><span>)</span></a>).


     
</p>
<p>
        As a result, the failed HA is unable to communicate with MRs
        and other HAs. The HA can not be used to register the Care-of Addresses,
        all tunnels established with this HA would be disrupted, and
        packets could not be redirected from the CNs to the mobile network
        anymore.  In addition, the MNPs registered by the MRs on this HA become
        unreachable, and the MRs cannot return home.

     
</p>
<p>
        A mechanism is needed to detect the failure of the HA and to
        redirect the traffic over an alternative tunnel (possibly
        newly established) between the same MR and another HA.
     
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor9">3.3</a>&nbsp;NEMO Tunnel Failure (C)</h4>

<p>
        Events happening between the MR and its HA (see point (C) on <a class="info" href="#fig:failure_analysis">Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class="info">Failure Analysis</span><span>)</span></a>) could cause the tunnel to be
        disrupted: e.g. one egress interface of the MR may fail, the
        access router may fail, the access network may be disconnected
        from the Internet, or the home link may fail.
     
    
</p>
<p> 
        The MR can not send Binding Updates nor receive incoming
        packets from the HA through this specific tunnel. However the
        MR may still be able to communicate with its peer HAs via
        other paths and other tunnels could established on another
        egress interface or via the other MR.

      
     
</p>
<p>
        A mechanism is needed to detect the tunnel failure and to
        redirect all the traffic over an alternative tunnel (possibly
	newly established), between the same or another (HA, MR) pair.
     
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor10">3.4</a>&nbsp;NEMO-Link Failure (A)</h4>

<p>
        Events happening between two MRs on the same NEMO may cause
        two MRs to be disconnected: e.g. the ingress interface of an MR
        may fail, or the link connecting the two MRs may fail (a cable
        or hub if Ethernet is used, of some radio interferences when a
        wireless technology is used).
     
</p>
<p>

        Each MR may continue to send Binding Updates to its HA. No
        established tunnel may be affected but the failure may cause
        the NEMO to split. As a result, the incoming packets to the
        mobile network may not reach the MNN the packet is bound
        to. Also, Multiple MRs connected to this NEMO-Link will not be
        able to communicate via this link anymore.

     
</p>
<p>
        A mechanism is therefore needed to detect the link failure and to act
        upon it.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;Requirements Analysis</h3>

<p>Path selection in multihomed NEMO is complex because there are
        several steps to determine a path. We thus classify the steps
        for path selection as follows (see <a class="info" href="#fig:path_selection">Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class="info">Path Selection</span><span>)</span></a>): (A) MNNs select the exit MRs
        as default routers, (B) the MRs select a path to the HAs, (C)
        the HAs select a path to the mobile network and (D) the CN
        select a path to the HAs.
     
</p>
<p>
        In the face of the failures highlighted previously, the path
        may need to be redirected from an MR to another. If the failure
        happens on the HA or the NEMO Tunnel, this redirection may be
        done in cooperation between the former MR to the new MR. If
        the failure happens on the MR or the NEMO-link, this
        redirection may be done by the new MR alone.
     
</p>
<p>
        The MNNs may send the packets to their default MR or they may
        have the ability to choose the MR, but in any case, the
        ultimate choice of the exit bi-directional tunnel falls on MRs
        hands. This choice could be made based on the source and
        destination address in the packet, or based on other
        parameters such as the availability of tunnels. For such
        selection to be made efficiently, MRs need to share
        information about the tunnels existing on the other MRs, the
        state of the MR, and other characteristics.

<p>
        The exchange of information will help each MR to determine the
        network conditions and available Internet accesses.  As the
        NEMO and tunnel infrastructures may change over time, it is
        mandatory that such information be regularly exchanged or that
        the exchange is triggered by an MR when a change is detected.
     
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor11">4.1</a>&nbsp;NEMO Tunnel Discovery</h4>

<p>
        Each MR must be aware of the tunnels established at other MRs
        with their respective HAs in order to know which paths are
        available to route packets to the Internet.  Both MRs and HAs
        should be aware of all NEMO tunnels between MRs and a HA(s)
        irrespectively of the administrative domain of the HA. A NEMO
        tunnel discovery mechanism is therefore required.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor13">4.3</a>&nbsp;MR State Discovery</h4>

<p>
	Each MR must be aware of its neighbor MRs' state. In case an MR is down, 
	this would avoid one MR to attempt cooperation with a failed 
	neighbor. This would also allow to trigger a relaying mechanism for
	the failed MR. In case an MR recovers from a failure, this would 
	allow to return to the initial state of the NEMO, and to stop any
	relaying mechanisms that was set up before the MR failed.

     
</p>
<p>
	By exchanging crucial information via the NEMO-link, each MR will 
	be able to discover when a neighbor MR has failed or recovered, 
	and to take some decisions to setup or stop a relaying mechanism.

     
</p>
<p>
	The MR state discovery mechanism should not assume any
	specific configuration of the NEMO. It should work either for
	MRs on the same NEMO-link, or for MRs on distinct NEMO-links
	as shown on <a class="info" href="#fig:failure_detection_between_different_nemo">Figure&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class="info">MRs Discovery Between Different NEMO-links</span><span>)</span></a>. However,
	in the latter case, special care must be taken so that such

<p>A MR usually connects to the access networks using wireless

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;Approaches</h3>

<p>
      In this section we investigate possible approaches to meet the
      requirements outlined in the previous section. One approach is
      to share mobility related information, and another to use
      standard protocols.
   
</p>
<p>The way to exchange information among neighbor MR may be 
      different if the MRs are located on the same link or in two 
      different links (connected via a router or another MR). In the 
      former case, sending the information to the all-router multicast 
      address or to the targeted MR's link local address will allow 
      the MRs to exchange information even if they are not on the same 
      IP network. In the latter case, a new mechanism to exchange the 
      information between the networks will be needed.
   
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor18">5.1</a>&nbsp;Mobility Approach</h4>

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor19">5.1.1</a>&nbsp;Binding Information Sharing</h4>

<p>MRs that are in the same mobile network can share among them 
	    the state of their binding information as well as some other 
	    important items, namely:

           </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Care-of Address / Prefix Length
               <br />
<br />


   	       By exchanging their Care-of Address(es) (with the
	       prefix length), different MRs will able to detect that
	       they are connecting to same access network. It is
	       (usually) not interesting that several MRs connect to
	       same access network regarding to redundancy, bandwidth
	       or battery purposes.  The MRs may able to turn off the
	       interfaces that are connected to the same access
	       network except for one interface.
             
</li>
<li>Home Address / Prefix Length
               <br />
<br />


	       By exchanging their Home Address(es) (with the prefix 
	       length), different MRs can know the home link of a specific 
	       MR, since the Home Address is built from the the MR's home 
	       link's prefix. 
             
</li>
<li>Mobile Network Prefix / Prefix Length
               <br />
<br />


 	         With the MNP and its prefix length, the MRs can know which 
		 MRs are advertising the same MNP to the NEMO. This could 
		 help to solve the Prefix Ownership issue (as described in 
		 <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-nemo-multihoming-issues">[5]<span> (</span><span class="info">Ng, C., Paik, E., Ernst, T., and M. Bagnulo, &ldquo;Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>) when 
		 a mobile network where several MRs advertise the same MNP 
		 splits.
              
</li>
<li>HA address
               <br />
<br />

 	         
		 With the HA address, MRs can know where a specific tunnel
	         ends. Thanks to this information, when a communication 
		 has to be diverted from one tunnel to another, ingress 
		 filtering can be avoided by choosing efficiently the new 
		 tunnel.
             
</li>
<li>Ingress interface's link-local address
               <br />
<br />


	       By exchanging their link local address, MRs on the same
	       link can communicate directly via the NEMO-link, even
	       if they are on two different IPv6 networks.
              
</li>
<li>Ingress interface's global address
               <br />
<br />


	       By exchanging their global address, MRs that are on the
	       same mobile network but not on the same link may be
	       able to communicate via the NEMO-link.
              
</li>
<li>Binding Lifetime
               <br />
<br />


 	         With the binding lifetime, each MR knows when other's MRs 
		 binding information have expired and can thus easily 
		 remove deprecated information.
             
</li>
<li>MR Identification (MR ID)
               <br />
<br />

	       
	       MR should be distinguished by an unique
	       identifier. This ID must not be duplicated in a same
	       mobile network.
             
</li>
<li>Tunnel Identification (tunnel ID)
	       <br />
<br />


               Tunnel Identification is necessary to be able to
               distinguish the multiple available path on a single
               MR. This ID must be unique on the same MR. 
             
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
	Those information can be maintained with the MR Identification 
	and the Tunnel Identification as key of the information database. 
	
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h4><a name="sec:condshare">5.1.2</a>&nbsp;Link Characteristics Sharing</h4>

<p>The parameters exchanged should be bound to the tunnel ID and 
	    the MR ID.
	 
</p>
<p>
            <a class="info" href="#I-D.morioka-nemo-mrcoop">[8]<span> (</span><span class="info">Morioka, H., &ldquo;Mobile Router Cooperation Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> is a solution that
            falls into this approach. It attempts to propose a link
            metric message exchange solution which allows MNNs to
            select the MR with the best link quality.
         
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor20">5.1.3</a>&nbsp;Policy Sharing</h4>

<p>Each policy exchanged should be bound to a tunnel ID and an 
	    MR ID.
	 
</p>
<p>The path for incoming packets to the mobile network may be 
	    selected by the HA. In this document we focus on MRs cooperation,
	    however it is recommended to share the same solution about policy 
	    sharing for both the MR-MR and MR-HA cases.
	 
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor21">5.2</a>&nbsp;Standard approach</h4>

<p>The standard approach would use or extend existing protocols 
	   to fit the requirements, such as:

<ul class="text">
<li>A routing protocol to announce and propagate the available 
	      path to the Internet inside the NEMO. Metrics such as 
	      described in <a class="info" href="#sec:condshare">Section&nbsp;5.1.2<span> (</span><span class="info">Link Characteristics Sharing</span><span>)</span></a> could also be

</li>
<li>Neighbor Discovery to discover the neighbor MRs located in

<p>
      In this document, we investigated the issues for NEMO
      configurations with multiple MRs. We have listed a number of
      requirements that should be met for MNNs and MRs to choose the
      most appropriate exit tunnel and to recover from a failure of
      the MR, the HA, the tunnel itself or the NEMO-link between
      MRs. We have started to investigate potential approaches and we
      outline one which is based on the exchange of mobility binding
      information, and a standard one using existing network routing
      protocols, router advertisement and prefix delegation
      mechanisms.
