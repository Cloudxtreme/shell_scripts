<P>
Label switching technology enables high performance, flexible, layer-3
packet forwarding based on the fixed length label information mapped
to the layer-3 packet stream.  A Label Switching Router (LSR) forwards
layer-3 packets based on their layer-3 address information or their
label information mapped to the layer-3 address information.
<P>
LSR requires one label per one packet stream.  Therefore, the
evaluation of the required number of labels are important from the viewpoint
of the implementation and the scalability of LSR.  The required
number of labels depends on a label mapping trigger and a granularity
of a packet stream.
<P>
Two typical label mapping policies have been evaluated with an actual
traffic trace.  One is traffic-driven label mapping with host-pair
packet stream.  This policy is used for IFMP[<A HREF="main.html#RFC1953">1</A>]
and FANP[<A HREF="main.html#RFC2098">2</A>, <A HREF="main.html#RFC2129">4</A>].  The other is
topology-driven label mapping with a destination network packet
stream. This policy is used for TDP[<A HREF="main.html#RFC2105">3</A>].  The evaluation shows
that both mapping policies will require a large number of labels in an
inter AS.
<P>
In this paper, we discuss several label mapping policies in an intra AS
and inter AS. 
Based on the evaluations, we propose the hybrid label mapping policy to 
establish LSP, i.e., topology driven for intra AS and aggregated flow driven
 for 
inter AS. 
Regarding the inter AS, we evaluate the number of labels for the
several label mapping policies using the real traffic trace.
In the intra AS, we compare three label mapping policies.
One of these label mapping policies is a flow aggregation using OSPF.
LSP (Label Switched Path) is established between an ingress router and
egress router which are border routers in an OSPF area.
We evaluate this label mapping policy in the actual LAN environment.
<P>

<A NAME="secoverview">&#160;</A>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">2.1 Architectural Overview</A></H2>
<P>
The label switching concept enables layer-3 packets to be forwarded either
using the layer-2 label (e.g., VPI/VCI) or using the shim label
[<A HREF="main.html#LSRARCH">7</A>] between the layer-2 header and layer-3 header.  The label is
used as information to forward the packets without analyzing the layer-3
address (e.g., IP address).  This means that the label represents the
destination address of the layer-3 packets.  By using the label instead of
the layer-3 address for packet forwarding, the LSR does not need to look up
anything in the best match policy based routing table, whose search key is
the layer-3 address.
<P>
The packet forwarding at the LSR is shown figure <A HREF="main.html#figLSR">1</A>.  The LSR has
a layer-3 forwarding engine and layer-2 forwarding engine.  It is connected
with two LSR-edge routers (Edge1 and Edge2).
<P>
LSRs are connected with two types of VC. One is the Default VC, and another
is the Label Switched VC.
<P>
The Default VC is used for conventional packet forwarding.  For example,
when Edge1 sends a packet to Edge2 using conventional packet forwarding,
Edge1 sends the packet through the default VC.  LSR receives it and
transmits it to the layer-3 forwarding engine through the layer-2
forwarding engine. The layer-3 forwarding engine of the LSR looks up the
routing table according to the destination of the packet and sends it
through the default VC.  Then, Edge 2 receives it.  LSR forwards the
packets using the layer-3 engine.
<P>
The Label Switched VC is used for cut-through packet forwarding. For
example, when Edge1 sends a packet to Edge2 using the cut-through packet
forwarding, Edge1 sends the packet through the label switched VC. LSR
receives it and forwards it using only the layer-2 forwarding engine to
send it through the Label Switched VC.  LSR forwards these packets
faster than with the conventional forwarding because LSR doesn't need to
look up the layer-3 packet.  The conjunction of the Label Switched VC is
called the Label Switched Path (LSP).
<P>
A relationship between the label and the packet stream needs for LSR to 
forward packets using the label.
Label Distributed Protocol (LDP) [<A HREF="main.html#LDP">6</A>] establishes the mapping between
the label and the packet stream.

<STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> LSR<BR>
<P>
<P>
One of major applications of LSR is ATM-LSR, that contains the ATM switch
module as a layer-2 forwarding engine.  ATM-LSR has to allocate a reassemble
buffer space for each label. Therefore, each ATM-LSR has the maximum number
of labels to be able to provide for the packet stream.  From the viewpoints
of the scalability and the implementation feasibility of LSR, it is
important to evaluate the required number of labels in a label switching
network. The required number of labels depends on the following three
parameters.
<P>
<UL><LI> Label mapping triggers<LI> Granularity of packet stream<LI> Scale of the network 
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">2.2 Label Mapping Triggers</A></H2>
<P>
There are two types of triggers to control the LSPs, which are
traffic-driven label mapping and topology-driven label mapping.
<P>
With the traffic-driven mapping, the LSP is established on demand according
to the appearance of data packets at a node.  The LSP is maintained as long
as packets are forwarded through the LSP.  When the node recognizes that the
LSP is not active any more, it is released.
<P>
With the topology-driven mapping, the LSP is established in advance
according to the routing protocol information.  For example, the LSP is
established when a routing entry is generated by the routing
protocol.  The LSP is maintained as long as the corresponding routing entry
exists. Therefore, it is released when the routing entry is deleted.
<P>
The advantage of the traffic-driven mapping would be
that the required amount of
label space is smaller than that for the topology-driven mapping, since the
LSP in the topology-driven mapping is established in advance even if a data
packet is not forwarded through it at all.
<P>
The advantage of the topology-driven mapping is that all data packets are
forwarded through the LSP.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">2.3 Granularity of Packet Stream</A></H2>

<P>
This section briefly describes evaluations for several label mapping
policies, regarding inter AS packet forwarding. 
We evaluate the number of labels and the cut-through ratio using a 
real internet traffic trace. 
A traffic trace is obtained
between the WIDE(Widely Integrated and Distributed Environment) project 
internet backbone in Japan and the U.S.
This is an AS border. Detailed traffic condition is described 
in [<A HREF="main.html#SPIE">10</A>].
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">3.2 Evaluations for Topology-Driven Mapping</A></H2>
<P>
In this subsection, we evaluate the number of labels for the conventional
topology-driven label mapping, where each label is mapped to the destination 
network packet stream shown in the routing table entry.
<P>
We evaluate the required number of labels, where we use the full-route 
routing table.  In this case, it could be
assumed that the analyzed LSR is located at the AS border.
The router has the full-route routing table.
The number of routing entries for the outside AS were 48385.
<P>
With full-route routing table, if the labels are established
with the conventional topology-driven mapping policy,
we may need 48385 labels for the traffic leaving the AS.
The result shows that, with the conventional
topology-driven policy, the number of required labels have to be 
large enough for the inter AS.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">3.3 Evaluations for Conventional Traffic-Driven Mapping</A></H2>
<P>
In this subsection, we evaluate the number of required labels for the
conventional traffic-driven mapping, that using the host-pair packet stream.
The parameters applied in the LSR are assumed as followings.
<P>
<UL><LI> The label-established trigger is invoked
  when the HTTP/FTP/TELNET/NNTP packets are sent.<LI> The label-released trigger is invoked when no packet is sent during
  the Disconnect Timer Interval.<LI> The delay of LDP is 100 ms.
The packets are transmitted using the conventional
  layer-3 forwarding function
  for 100 ms, after the label-established trigger is invoked.
</UL>
<P>
Figure <A HREF="main.html#fighostpair">2</A> shows the number of the required labels
and cut-through ratios for the outgoing traffic from the AS.
In figure <A HREF="main.html#fighostpair">2</A>,
the cut-through ratio is almost the same
when the disconnect timer interval is more than 60 seconds.  This result
indicates that the value of the disconnect timer interval should be 60 seconds.
The number of labels with the host-pair packet stream outgoing from the AS
is 1131,
when the disconnect timer interval is 60 seconds.
<P>
The result shows that a large number of labels are required for the
conventional traffic-driven mapping with the host-pair packet stream in the
Internet backbone area.

<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00034000000000000000">3.4 Evaluations for Flow Aggregated Traffic-Driven Mapping</A></H2>
<P>
In this subsection, we describe the number of required labels 
and the cut-through ratio for the flow aggregated traffic-driven mapping,
that is used the ingress-egress packet stream.
Here, the label is mapped with the set of packets which have the same 
destination network prefix. 
The parameters applied in the LSR are the same as the conventional
traffic-driven mapping.
Figure <A HREF="main.html#figtoabroadfullcon">3</A>, <A HREF="main.html#figtoabroadfullpkt">4</A> show
the number of the required labels and the cut-through ratio.
As same as the previous evaluation, the disconnect timer value is
selected as 60 seconds.
At the AS border router, the number of labels are 542. The cut-through ratio 
is 80 %. 
The number of labels with this policy are 48%
of that with the traffic-driven mapping with the host-pair granularity, 
and 1.1% of that with the topology-driven mapping with the destination
granularity.
<P>
The cut-through ratio of the flow aggregated
traffic-driven mapping is better than that of the
traffic-driven with the host-pair. 
And, the cut-through ratio for the topology 
driven mapping is further better than
that of the flow aggregated traffic-driven mapping. 
However, the cut-through ratio with the flow aggregated traffic-driven 
mapping should be enough large for the actual operation, i.e., 
it is more than 80%.
<P>
Based on the above evaluations, we conclude that the aggregated 
traffic-driven mapping is better than the topology-driven 
mapping because the proposed label mapping policy needs fairly 
small number of labels, while achieving high cut-through ratio. 
In other words, the above result shows 
tha the flow aggregated traffic-driven mapping policy is
better when LSPs are established between ASes.

<P>
This section proposes and evaluates the Hybrid Label Mapping 
Policy.
<P>
For the inter AS environment, the aggregated traffic-driven label 
mapping is proposed.
The aggregated traffic-driven label mapping policy reduces the 
number of LSPs and increases
the cut-through ratio.
The result shows on demand LSP setup procedure is useful at the AS border 
router which has the full-route routing table,
because small number of the routing entries are referred when the packets are 
forwarded.
<P>
For the intra AS environment, we need to be establish an LSP 
from a router in an AS to 
a router outside of the AS because the intermediate LSRs want
to cut-through the network layer procedure.
A label mapping policy for the intra AS is also proposed and 
evaluated below.
<P>
The aggregated traffic-driven label mapping may not be always
efficient in the intra AS, due to the following reasons. 
 <UL><LI> the number of routing entries in the intra AS are smaller 
than that in the inter AS<LI> the large percentage of routing entries may be referred to, i.e., 
only small number of routing entries may not be referred to, during the
traffic-driven Disconnect Timer Interval.
</UL>
<P>
The followings would be possible procedures to establish an LSP for 
intra AS.
<P>
<OL><LI> <A NAME="pfirst">&#160;</A> Traffic-driven mapping with host-pair granularity
  (Conventional traffic-driven)<LI> <A NAME="psecond">&#160;</A> Traffic-driven mapping with destination network granularity

  (Conventional Topology-driven)<LI> <A NAME="pforth">&#160;</A> Topology-driven mapping with ingress-egress router granularity
  (Full-mesh LSP between LSR edges)
</OL>
<P>
The above policies are evaluated from the viewpoint of the trade off between 
evaluated the required number of LSPs and the control overhead (i.e., LSP setup 
overhead).
<P>
Policy 4 is better than policy 3. 
This is because the number of LSPs 
with policy 4 are smaller than that with policy 3, 
when MPLS domain is a subset of AS. With the policy 3, 
LSR establishes multiple LSPs to the same egress router, 
because the egress router 
is on the path of multiple routing entries.
<P>
As we evaluated in [<A HREF="main.html#DSM">11</A>], 
the number of labels with the policy 4 is about two times less
than that with policy 1.
<P>
The policy 4 reduces LSP setup procedure overhead, since 
it establishes LSPs in advance. Furthermore, the number of LSPs 
with policy 4 should not large, because 
the number of the ingress routers should not large in one AS. 
As a result, we conclude that the policy 4 is better 
than the policy 2, 
even if the number of LSPs with the policy 2 is smaller than that
with the policy 4.
<P>
Based on the above evaluations and discussions, we propose the 
following label mapping policy in the LSR system, i.e., Hybrid Label Mapping
Policy. 
For intra AS, the topology-driven mapping based on ingress-egress routers is
applied to. 
For inter AS, the aggregated traffic-driven mapping is 
applied to.
<P>
Figure <A HREF="main.html#figlabel">5</A> shows an operational overview of the proposed label
mapping 
policy.  The network contains multiple ASes, and ASes are internetworked
by the boarder routers.  
Within the AS, the topology-driven based semi-permanent (i.e., long-life) 
LSP are established among the border routers.  
For the packet stream to the outside own AS, the corresponding 
label is dynamically allocated at the AS border router while the packets 
are forwarded to the destination network.  
Once the activity of packet forwarding decreases, the corresponding 
LSP is released. 
Also, when we define the packet flow as the set of packets which 
have the same destination network prefix,
the packet flows can be aggregated at the 
AS border router.  This flow aggregation can also reduce the 
required number of labels in the LSR system.

<IMG SRC="fig5.gif" HEIGHT=200><BR>
<STRONG>Figure 5:</STRONG> Hybrid Label Mapping<BR>
<P>
In order to achieve the &quot;Hybrid Label Mapping&quot;, 
we proposed to use the label stack encoding [<A HREF="main.html#labelencap">9</A>] mechanism.
Figure <A HREF="main.html#figlabelencap">6</A> shows an example of LSPs through multiple AS.
Top label,
e.g., VPI/VCI in ATM, is used for LSP in an AS.
The label distribution is performed between the neighbor LSRs.
In figure <A HREF="main.html#figlabelencap">6</A>,
the LSP from R1 to R3 uses the top label. The label distribution protocol is
performed between R1 and R2, R2 and R3.
<P>
Second level of label, e.g., shim header, is used among AS.  This
label is distributed between AS border router.
For example, in figure <A HREF="main.html#figlabelencap">6</A>, the label distribution of 
the second label is performed between R1 and R3.
When R1 sends the packet to R5, R1 puts the second and the top labels
before the IP datagram header. In this example,
the top label uses for the LSP toward R3, and
the second label is used for the LSP toward R8 or R7.
R2 forwards the packet using the top label for the
cut-through forwarding.
R3 forwards the packet using the second label
because R3 is the LSP termination node regarding the top label.
R3 puts the top label toward R5 and the second label toward R8.
<P>
Using the above algorithm, the required number of
top level label will be small enough to implement. 
This is because the LSPs are established only among 
AS border routers using OSPF flow aggregation, described in the 
following subsections. 
Second label is established by the traffic-driven label mapping for
the destination network.

In this subsection, we propose the LSP establishment mechanism and
implementation
in an OSPF domain. 
The topology-driven LSP is established between the ingress and  egress
border routers using the OSPF information.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00042100000000000000">4.2.1 Route Calculation of OSPF</A></H3>
<P>
An OSPF router, which uses an OSPF routing protocol, has the 
complete network topology and link cost information 
in the belonging OSPF domain.  
Also, every OSPF area border router informs the external network 
reachability information to the neighbor OSPF router(s). 
All OSPF routers obtains exactly the same topology, link cost 
and external network reachability 
information through the OSPF message exchange 
between the neighbor OSPF router(s).
Every OSPF router calculates an appropriate next hop router 
using these informations with the same shortest path algorithm.
<P>
Fig. <A HREF="main.html#figtopology">7</A> shows an example of OSPF route calculation.
This figure shows a topology information and a cost of links at R1.
The packet transmission path from R1 to the destination
is described as the bold line.
When R1 wants to send a packet to R2, R1 sends the packet to R2.
When R1 wants to send a packet to R3 or R4 or R5,
R1 sends the packet to R3. 
When R1 wants to send a packet to network A, R1 sends the packet to R3. 
This is because R1 knows the network A is reachable through border 
router R4, and the routing path through R4 is the shortest path to 
network A.  
Finally, when R1 wants to send a packet to network B, 
R1 sends the packet to R3. 
This is because the network B is reachable through border 
router R5, and the routing path through R5 is the shortest path to 
network B.

<P>
 In this subsection, we describe how to reduce the number of labels using
OSPF information. An LSP is established between an
ingress and egress routers which are border routers in the OSPF area.
In this procedure, packets which are forwarded from the
ingress router to the egress router are transmitted through the LSP, that is
established among the boarder routers.  
The following three
information has to be obtained by each boarder router.
<P>
<OL><LI> <A NAME="first">&#160;</A> An ingress router recognizes the egress router
  which is the router terminating the corresponding LSP.<LI> <A NAME="second">&#160;</A> An ingress router establishes the LSP
  to the egress router.<LI> <A NAME="third">&#160;</A> An ingress router specifies the corresponding
  egress router for every received the packets.
</OL>
<P>
There are two methods to achieve the first function. 
One is automatic configuration,
the other is manual configuration.
In this paper, the manual configuration is applied to.
Regarding the second function, 
LSR establishes the LSP using a label distribution protocol. 
The evaluated system below uses the
FANP(Flow Attribute Notification Protocol) 
as the label distribution protocol.
With the third function, all packets forwarded through the same 
boarder router use the LSP between the corresponding ingress 
and egress routers. 
In other words, even when the destination network is different, 
the packets use the same LSP, when the OSPF indicates 
these packets should be forwarded through the same border 
router. 
As a result, all packets forwarded through the same 
border router can share a single LSP between the corresponding 
ingress and egress routers.
<P>
Since the packet flows forwarded through the same egress router 
are aggregated into the shared single LSP, this label switch packet 
forwarding policy is denoted as the &quot;flow aggregation using OSPF 
information&quot;, in this paper.
<P>
Figure <A HREF="main.html#figtopologylsp">8</A> shows an example of an LSP setup from the 
ingress router R1.  A network manager configures that R4 and R5 are egress
routers.  R1 establishes the LSP to each egress routers. An LSP
to the egress router R4 is R1  R3  R5 
R4. In the figure <A HREF="main.html#figtopology">7</A>, the
destinations through R4 are R4 itself and the network A. 
Therefore, the packets to R4 and the network A are transferred 
through the same LSP from R1 to R4. 
In other words, the packets to R4 and to the network A from R1 share 
the single LSP.  
An LSP
to R5 establishes through R1  R3  R5.
This LSP forwards the packets to R5 and
the network B. In this example, two ingress-egress LSPs are established
using the OSPF information.

<A NAME="secevaluation">&#160;</A>
The required number of LSPs with the OSPF flow aggregation at an ingress
router are the same number of egress routers. For example, when MPLS domain 
has ten of edge routers, each edge LSR establishes nine LSPs.
<P>
We implement the LSR system, which uses ingress-egress granularity 
using a CSR system, which is one of an implementation of LSR.  
We evaluate this implementation at an LAN environment.
The network has 5 edge routers and 1 core router, with a star topology.
Figure <A HREF="main.html#figMRTG">9</A> shows the number of LSPs at the core router.
X-axis shows the time. Y-axis shows the number of established LSPs.
The number of LSPs are 20 for the most of the time. 
This number (20) is the ideal number with this system configuration. 
The ideal number should be , where N are the number of the
edge routers. The number of LSPs are sometimes less than 20. 
When the number of LSPs decrease, the edge router(s) was(were) 
rebooted and the number of border routers in the OSPF database 
decreased.
<P>
The result shows that the implemented OSPF flow aggregation

In this paper, we discuss the label mapping policy in an inter AS and intra 
AS.
And, we propose the hybrid label mapping policy.
It is mixture of the topology-driven mapping with the ingress-egress
granularity in an intra AS and the traffic-driven mapping with the
destination granularity.
Also, we discuss and implement the flow aggregation using
OSPF information, which is one procedure of the topology-driven mapping
with the ingress-egress granularity. The implementation works correctly 
in the LAN environment.
One of the further study item would be the comparison of the number of labels 
for the topology-driven mapping with the ingress-egress granularity 
and the aggregated traffic-driven mapping in
an intra AS environment.
