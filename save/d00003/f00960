Censorship in Australia</h1>

<blockquote>"Can someone please explain to me why is it that everytime
someone talks about enforcing "the standards of morality, decency and propriety

The Senate Select Committee on Information Technology received the following
paper on 31 April 1999.
<p>Of course, they ignored every word in their <a href="http://www.anatomy.usyd.edu.au/danny/freedom/senate/index.html">majority

on committees which examine "controversial" publications unless he intends
to ban them, and <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/senators/homepages/web/s-O15.htm">Senator Tierney's</a> views are equally well known. The <a href="http://www.democrats.org.au">Democrats</a>
put up a valiant fight, but they were a minority of one on this particular
committee.
<p>I never thought they'd go as far as they did, though: There were a total
of 104 submissions to that committee, and only a handful of them were supportive
of <a href="http://www.ozemail.com/~mbaker/amended.html">the law</a> being
questioned. Most of the supportive messages came from companies which have
a vested interest in <a href="http://www.censorware.net">censorware</a>,
such as
<a href="http://www.aol.com">America Online</a> and <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/Publish/report_isheriff.html">Clairview</a>.
<p>The legislation went to the senate, and was passed with amendments on
May 26th 1999.
<p>On May 28th and May 30th, <a href="http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/may28">national
protests</a> were held, including protest marches/rallies in Brisbane,
Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. I <a href="../may30.html">spoke</a>
at the Adelaide rally, to about 250 brave souls who withstood the awful
weather.
<p>The Bill was supposed to be debated in the House of Reps on Monday 31st
May, but it doesn't look like that'll happen now: it'll probably be June
21. If you care about this stuff, <i>call your <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/mi-elctr.asp">member

<br>&nbsp;<p>
I've also written a <a href="alston_letter.html">letter</a>

<h1>
Introduction and Executive Summary</h1>
I wish to express my opposition to the Government's Broadcasting Services
Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999.
<p>I have been an Internet user for ten years, and have worked in the Internet
Industry for seven of those years. The Internet has formed a large part
of my life: I work there, I have friends and comrades there, I participate
in communities of people with common interests, I communicate with like-minded
souls. I use the Internet in a way that members of this committee might
be more accustomed to using a telephone or a fax machine: It is an essential
communications medium used to conduct the affairs of my professional and
private life.
<p>If this bill passes, I will never be able to be confident that I'll
be able to use the Internet in the way in which I am accustomed. I have
spent several years watching the efforts of some of the experts in the
field come up with ways to censor the Internet, and they've all failed
miserably. Given the amazing way in which the Federal Government seems
to make a mess of every sensitive political issue it attempts to barge
its way into, and given that the technical aptitude of the people who have
been responsible for coming up with the Government's regulatory scheme
is so demonstrably inadequate, I have absolutely no confidence in the ability
of the Government to perform any better than those experts.
<p>This issue will probably be the only one that will decide my vote at
the next election. I know I am not alone in thinking that: I am in daily
contact with mailing lists of thousands of Australians who are almost unanimously
against these regulations, and almost every one of those people own interests
in Internet small businesses which will be bankrupted if Senator Alston's
content regulation scheme is allowed to proceed unchecked.
<p>I have several totally separate grounds for objecting to the bill, any
one of which ought to be sufficient to totally oppose its passing:
<ol>
<li>
The bill does not address its stated goals, in that it will provide absolutely
no protection whatsoever for children;</li>

<li><a name="new-class">
The legislation will create a new class of content which is illegal on
the Internet but perfectly legal in other media. As such, it represents
a fundamental attack on the freedom of speech which Australians are accustomed
to enjoying;</li>

<li>
The legislation threatens Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with fines
of $27,500 per day if they do not block content which the ABA orders them
to block, even though there is no conceivable technological method ISPs
can use to comply with those orders (as shown by the CSIRO's report, "Blocking
Content on the Internet: A Technical Perspective," prepared for Senator
Alston's National Office for the Information Economy (NOIE) in June 1998).
The threat of unavoidable criminal penalties and the expense of attempting
to comply with the new law will drive most Australian ISPs out of business,
especially small regional ISPs. As such, it will make a mockery of the
Government's efforts to improve Internet access in the bush and promote
competition in the telecommunications industry;</li>

<li>
The bill will seriously damage Australia's ability to participate in the
world-wide online economy, since Australia will be one of the few countries
anywhere in the world with such stringent and stultifying controls;</li>

<li>
The bill is unnecessary, since sufficient controls already exist to achieve
the Government's stated goals, both by enforcing existing classification
law (which already applies to the Internet) and by allowing parents to
continue their practice of applying their own content controls for their
own children. By enforcing Government-mandated content controls, this Bill
actually serves to <i>reduce</i> parental control and responsibility over
the conduct of children.</li>

<li>
The additional censorship measures are opposed by over 83% of the population
of Australia (<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/970425/nsp3.txt.htm">The
Age, 25 April 1997</a>). According to a poll conducted by Channel 9's <i>Sunday</i>
programme on April 25 1999, 84% of participants indicated that Senators
meddling with Media content rules was worse than realistic portrayals of
explicit sex and physical violence.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</ol>
I will address each of these concerns in more detail below.
<p>I would also like to make the point that manifest dishonesty from the
Government has tended to make rational debate on this matter virtually
impossible. The Internet industry says, "It's impossible"; The Government
shows its abysmal comprehension of the issue by saying, "We shouldn't avoid
doing it just because it's difficult." The Internet Industry says, "It
creates a stupid class of material which is legal offline and criminalized
online"; The Government counters by saying, "We are trying to make Internet
regulation parallel regulation in other media," again in blatant disregard
for the facts and the truth. The Internet Industry says, "It's technically
impossible, we can't do business under this regime," and the Government
retaliates with a thoroughly insulting press release which bunches Internet
providers who don't support it into the same basket as paedophiles, drug
dealers and terrorists.
<p>It has been tremendously difficult to carry out serious discussions
over the topic of content regulation when every time an Internet-associated
group says something, Senator Alston has come forth with astonishing rhetoric
which completely distorts what they have said. No finer example can be
seen than the one from The Australian on Tuesday 27 April, where the Minister
said he had the support of the Australian Computer Society -- Just days
after the ACS had released its submission to this very Committee condemning
the new legislation.
<p>For these reasons, attempting to have rational debate with Senator Alston
has been an immensely frustrating experience, and I believe the Information
Technology Industry, which he seems intent on destroying, would be well-served
by demanding his resignation from his post as Information Technology Minister.
<p>I strongly urge the Select Committee to strike down the Bill. It is
so fundamentally flawed that we as a nation are better off without it.
A simple list of amendments is not enough; the Bill must be defeated entirely.
<h1>
The Bill does not address its stated goals</h1>
In introducing his Second Reading Speech to the Bill, Senator Richard Alston
claimed that the bill was intended to:
<blockquote>... enact a regime which balances the need for the Government
to meet legitimate community concerns about the publication of illegal
and offensive material online, that is commensurate with the regulation
of conventional media, while ensuring that regulation does not place onerous
or unjustifiable burdens on industry and inhibit the development of the
online economy.</blockquote>
The Minister then went on to describe a Bill which:
<ul>
<li>
fabricates "legitimate community concerns": Concerns about the availability
of "controversial" material have been shown time and time again to be nothing
more than the disproportionately large howls of a very small minority of
the Australian population. Australians love their freedom, and this Bill
relies on lies and deceit about the extent of community concern, the types
of material available on the Internet, and the preexisting legal controls
on that material to justify a case for severely eroding that freedom;</li>

<li>
Bears no resemblance whatsoever to regulation of conventional media: What
is legal in print will be totally prohibited on the Internet. <i>The content
of all discourse on the Internet in Australia, regardless of its audience,
will be reduced to that which is suitable for a child</i>.</li>

<li>
Places onerous and unjustifiable burdens on industry: The Government wishes
to empower the ABA to make demands on the industry which are totally impossible
to comply with. Not just "difficult," but <i>totally impossible</i>. If
ISPs and Content Hosting providers fail to meet those demands, they will
be fined up to $27,500 per day. The best the Minister has yet been able
to come up with to explain this ludicrous state of affairs is, <i>"It is
not acceptable to make no attempt at all on the basis that it may be difficult"</i>
(Second Reading speech and many, many press releases), but that comment
betrays the Minister's profound ignorance about the media he wishes to
regulate</li>

<li>
Inhibits the development of the online economy: It is trivial for a company
to go to an overseas content hosting company to hold their web pages, and
the atmosphere of uncertainty about what, exactly, the ABA will rule against,
coupled with the severe performance penalty we will pay for the Government's
international content blocking system (which won't work anyway because
it's impossible) will make overseas hosting of Australian content the rule,
rather than the exception.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</ul>
In addressing "community concerns," the Government makes a very large show
of how much this Bill will prevent drug dealers, paedophiles and terrorists
from corrupting our children. Unfortunately, however, the bill doesn't
address any of those nefarious categories of humanity at all.
<p>Drug dealing is already illegal, and information or advocacy about drugs
(including how to purchase them) is not something which the OFLC can use
to make a classification judgement, except in noting that advocacy of drug
taking will earn an "R" rating. But R-rated material will not be blocked
from overseas servers, so it is of little consequence. We will, however,
have the somewhat ridiculous situation where putting R-rated material on
an Internet host in Sydney to inform people about where to buy drugs in
Australia will be a criminal offense under this bill, but putting exactly
the same material on a host in the United States will produce no legal
ramifications whatsoever. This provision makes even less sense when you
consider that there's no reason at all for those two Internet sites to
be distinguishable: The US version could even have an Australian
<i>.com.au</i>
name!
<p>Paedophilia is also already illegal, and ISPs and state-based industry
associations have a long and favourable history of cooperation with local
law enforcement authorities to bring justice to bear on the vanishingly
small number of individuals who have used Internet technology to distribute
that kind of material. This bill is totally unnecessary to protect children
against paedophiles.
<p>Terrorists aren't addressed at all: There is no provision in this Bill
to regulate bomb making data, terrorist advocacy sites, hate sites, international
propoganda, or anything else commonly associated with terrorism. If I published
a web page providing detailed instructions for the construction of a pipe
bomb, the OFLC would give it an M rating at worst. Even if the bill did
address the prospect of children finding information about terrorism, we
would be forced to ask, (a) is it a bad thing for children to see the depths
of man's inhumanity to man so that our young can make the decision to not
follow in their footsteps? and (b) how could we stop such content anyway?
<p>Even if we suspended disbelief enough to consider that the bill did
legitimately address its stated goals, there is still another matter to
consider: How does the Government expect to be able to ban Internet content?
Answer: It has absolutely no idea. This Bill makes no attempt whatsoever
to explain how the Government expects to be able to achieve its aims.
<p>There's a simple reason for that: For many years, the Internet Industry,
through state and national industry bodies, have been attempting to educate
the Government about the impossibility of regulating Internet content.
Senator Alston, Senator Harradine, and Prime Minister Howard do not like
to hear things like that, however: Each time a member of the Internet Industry
has said the word, "Impossible," the Government has substituted the word
"difficult." It has then written a bill which is based on the idea that
content controls are rational and possible, and that the only reason the
Internet Industry is objecting is because complying with the legislation
is too hard and the Industry is too lazy.
<p>This is simply not the case. Members of the Internet Industry have always
been very precise with our language: When we say, "Impossible," we mean,
"Impossible."
<a name="convergence">
<p>The Government has no alternative but to understand that the Internet
has made the entire concept of censorship obsolete. It is no longer possible
to prevent an individual from publishing anything they wish to publish,
nor is it technologically possible to prevent an individual from accessing
the publications of others. Furthermore, even if the Government takes action
against a particular site, anonymity through encryption technology means
that they cannot even work out which country the individual who runs the
site lives in, so bringing "justice" to bear against them is, like the
rest of this Bill, impossible.
<p>Even if the Government completely shuts down the traditional Internet
access in Australia, satellite services will ensure that Australians can
still publish and receive information, just like Iranians can still view
illegal Western TV programmes by deploying dishes in their ceilings. It
will be a very sad comment on the Australian Government's respect for the
democratic principles upon which this country was founded if the only way
citizens can get reasonable Internet access is through covert methods,
however.
<p>The Government wishes to entertain the fiction that the way to make
Internet content controls consistent with other media is by placing an
onerous and paternalistic set of controls on the Internet just like TV,
radio and print publications must exist under. This view is sheer idiocy,
however: The way to bring Internet content regulation in-line with other
media is to <i>relax controls on other media</i>.
<p>As strange as it may sound to members of this committee, that is precisely
where we are heading. When bandwidth is economically available in sufficient
quantities to permit TV stations to broadcast on the Internet, they will
find a country with an amenable censorship framework (such as the United
States) and do precisely that -- And they'll be able to transmit whatever
they like to whomever they like, anywhere in the world, whether the Australian
Government likes it or not. There are no controls the Australian Government
or the Australian Internet Industry can devise which will stop this --
Convergence of technology does not mean that the Internet must be regulated
like TV, it means TV regulation will be rendered pointless.
<p>The Australian Government should be attracting that kind of investment
to Australia; Instead, it's attempting to doom Australia to an information
technology backwater, where Australians are mere consumers of content from
other countries. Some Senators might take the view that keeping people
who wish to publish material prohibited by this bill out of Australia is
a desirable outcome, but that attitude does a profound injustice to the
Australian Information Industry: Even if a content provider wished to broadcast
material which wouldn't run afoul of this bill they won't do it from Australia
because this bill will make Australian Internet access too expensive.
<p>Witness what we have already seen in other media: Books which have been
banned by the OFLC can be read online (often for free), and attempts to
suppress them have only increased their distribution by giving them notoriety
and encouraging other Internet Content Hosting sites to "mirror" them (making
them <i>impossible</i> to block). Some publications which have been banned
by the OFLC, such as <i>"Steal This Book"</i> and <i>"The Anarchist's Cookbook"</i>
have been made available on the Internet for free by foreign nationals
specifically <i>because</i> they are banned in Australia, and those individuals
wish to make a mockery of Australia's ridiculous publications classification
system. The Internet has rendered that system essentially obsolete, and
literally nothing can be done about that.
<p>Overseas radio stations routinely broadcast over the Internet, and with
a suitably equipped computer and free software downloaded from the Internet,
you can listen to anything you want, whether it's from the mouths of terrorists,
pornographers, or Senators. Any regulation from the ACA or the OFLC is
utterly impossible -- And it will forever be that way.
<p>TV will be next. Then Video. And with each new step, another part of
the OFLC's job becomes nothing more than a historical relic of times past
when Governments were too insecure to allow people access to the things
they actually want to read, hear, see or publish.
<p>That is the future. This committee can stand in front of this rising
tide of reality with its finger in the virtual dyke, but eventually they
will be overtaken -- And the nation will be overtaken with it, because
nobody will want to host content in this country for fear of the Government's
content controls and because the cost will be prohibitive. Australia will
be to the Information Age what Romania was to the Industrial Age.
<p>I repeat, lest it has not yet sunk in or in case it's a thought too
appalling for the members of this committee to bear: <i>The Internet has
made censorship obsolete.</i> This has happened. It cannot be turned back.
We're not talking about something that <i>will</i> happen, or something
that can be stopped if we all sit down and think about it for a while;
We're talking about something that happened decades ago without the Government
realizing. No matter how carefully the Government drafts its legislation,
it will be ineffective. And heed me well: This legislation is <i>not</i>
carefully drafted.
<p>The Government's bill cannot hope to even remotely achieve any of its
stated aims. The entire technology basis of the Internet has had thirty
years worth of design and evolution around the idea that halting delivery
of requested data should be as difficult as possible. The Government wishes
to fundamentally redesign the Internet in Australia, believing itself to
be more knowledgable on the matter than the experts who have had decades
of experience putting it together. This wholly unbelievable exercise in
arrogance is being perpetuated in response to a totally illusory "community
concern" fabricated by Senator Alston, Senator Harradine and John Howard
to suit their petty moral agenda. For that reason, if not for any other,
the bill should be shot down in flames.
<h1>
Material legal in other media will be illegal on the Internet</h1>
At the present time any one of us could start a publishing company which
produces R-rated publications which are available at every newsagent in
Australia.
<p>If I buy a scanner and feed the paper-based publication into it, I will
end up with a set of files on the hard disk of my computer which contain
an exact photographic duplicate of the magazine.
<p>Once I have those files, I might decide that it's time for my hypothetical
publishing company to enter the Information Age (hundreds of Australian
small businesses make this decision every day, making the material they
traditionally sell "terrestrially" available over the Internet). One business
model I might pursue would be to make selected portions of each month's
issue available on my web site, encouraging viewers to go out and buy the
"real" version of the publication. Or I might just make the whole thing
available on the world wide web, ceasing distribution of paper altogether
(after all, printing and freight are both expensive).
<p>So, to recap: We have a publication which the OFLC has classified "R".
We have a set of hard disk files which constitute an exact duplicate of
that publication. You can buy the print version of the publication in any
bookstore or newsagent in Australia -- What about the online version?
<p>Unfortunately, if I ran a web server which insisted on making the online
version of the <i>very same publication</i> available on the Internet,
this bill would make me a criminal. The Bill prohibits the distribution
of R-rated material from Australian servers. I do have an "out" if I place
my material behind a shield provided by an adult verification service,
but that'll make my entire business unviable:
<ul>
<li>
Potential customers would not be able to read through my publication without
providing a name, address and credit card number first. This has tremendous
privacy implications which this Bill pretends don't exist; The requirement
to provide identification before accessing "controversial" content will
also discourage the vast majority of visitors from registering with the
adult verification service anyway;</li>

<li>
Adult Verification Services can be expensive;</li>

<li>
Adult Verification Services don't actually work: They rely on nothing more
than a credit card number to prove adulthood, but a credit card without
a zero-dollar credit limit can be legally obtained by a minor. Additionally,
many overseas companies offer credit cards to allcomers regardless of age
over the Internet, with impunity from Australian laws, so a resourceful
child who really wanted to read my publication could do so with by spending
a few minutes filling out an online credit application and waiting for
a couple of weeks for their card to arrive; Once received, the card would
provide them with unfettered access to all the sites this Bill wishes to
keep them away from</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</ul>
With all the problems Adult Verification Services cause, I don't actually
need to use them: According to this bill, it'd be perfectly legal to just
upload my web pages to a server in the United States, whereupon they can
be viewed by Australians without restriction whether I have an Adult Verification
Service or not. Thus far, every attempt made by every US Federal and State
Government to regulate the Internet has run afoul of their constitution,
meaning that it's effectively globally impossible to prevent publication
of any content permitted by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.
<p>The end effect of this is to provide significant encouragement for me
to abandon the Australian Internet Industry, while providing absolutely
no limitations whatsoever on the abilities of Australians to access my
publication.
<p>There are already important stimuli for Australian companies to use
the resources of the United States for hosting their Internet content:
<ul>
<li>
Due to political mismanagement, Telstra's costs are so high by world standards
that the cost of providing Internet content from the US is negligible compared
to the cost of providing it locally;</li>

<li>
Also due to Telstra's pricing policies: Bandwidth is available in abundance
in the US, while Australia limps along with ridiculously congested and
over-expensive international network links. This translates directly into
access speeds; An overwhelming majority of the world's population can access
US Internet sites quicker than Australian sites.</li>
</ul>
With these significant obstacles already hampering the Australian Internet
industry, the Government wishes to make business even more difficult for
us by driving our customers offshore.
<p>The situation for X-rated material is even more bizarre. In Canberra
I can publish an X-rated videotape or magazine and sell it to every adult
in Australia without limitation. But if I turn that same videotape or magazine
into a file on my hard disk I will face sanctions of up to $27,500 per
day if I sell it online, <i>even if I use an adult verification service</i>.
This is a farcical state of affairs, which runs in direct opposition to
the dozens of press releases the Minister himself has released on this
very issue: The Minister seeks to make Internet regulation mirror the regulation
of other media, but his legislation creates criminals out of people who
seek to use the Internet to distribute that which is perfectly legal in
any other distribution channel in the country.
<p>If the Government wishes to bring Internet regulation in-line with other
forms of media, it can most effectively do so by relaxing controls on other
forms of media. The population of Australia is responsible, intelligent,
and offended by efforts undertaken by paternalistic Governments to restrict
what they can say, read, see or hear. The Government would be well-respected
if it heeded the wishes of 83% of the Australian population by acquiescing
to the values of freedom and rejection of tyranny which we strive for.
In that sense, it is ironic that this submission is being written in the
same week as Anzac Day, a day which commemorates the sacrifices Australian
soldiers have made to secure the very freedoms which Senator Alston wishes
to strip away.
<h1>
Criminal Sanctions for Internet Service Providers</h1>
In the myriad of press releases full of Senator Alston's rhetoric dating
back to last year, he has always stated that Internet Service Providers
should not be responsible for material authored by someone else, nor should
they be responsible for "pass-through" traffic that they can't possibly
know about.
<p>That was a bare-faced lie, another reason why the Internet Industry
has been finding it increasingly difficult to work with Senator Alston.
This Bill carries criminal sanctions, including fines of up to $27,500
per day if ISPs don't censor "pass-through" traffic that they can't possibly
know about.
<p>The Bill creates a framework for the ABA to issue "take-down" notices
for material which is rated R, X or RC on Australian servers. Note that
RC is <i>already</i> illegal, and ISPs have a long history of cooperating
with law enforcement to obliterate it. Note also that R and X ratings do
not include paedophiles, drug-dealers or terrorists (otherwise known as
"The Three Horsemen of the Internet Apocalypse" by some of our more cynical
civil libertarians, who observe them being trotted out like flag-bearers
every time a politician or media reporter makes comment on the Internet
-- Even though they represent such an infinitesimally small portion of
the Internet at large that it's actually incredibly difficult to find them
even if you <i>want</i> to).
<p>Failure to observe a take-down notice renders the ISP criminally liable.
It makes no difference that the take-down notice covers material which
is perfectly legal in other media (again, despite Senator Alston's lies
to the contrary).
<p>The ABA is also authorized to issue a take-down notice in respect of
offshore content if it's rated X or RC (incredibly, Australians can view
R-rated sites if they're not within Australian borders). If an Internet
Service Provider fails to comply with the takedown notice, it's liable
for $27,500 in fines for each day of non-compliance; Furthermore, the ABA
is authorized to seek a court order to shut-down the ISP's services altogether.
<p>This incredible regime is supposed to work in blatant disregard of the
knowledge that there is no way of adhering to ABA takedown notices. If
an ISP takes-down a domestic site, the individual who has published it
can take it to an overseas site and serve it up with impunity.
<p>Blocking overseas sites is even more problematic: No technological means
exists to make this happen without slowing down the Internet to the point
where it's virtually unusable, and making it too expensive for most people
to use. Complicated access-lists at the router require memory and CPU resources
which are outrageously expensive, especially for small regional ISPs serving
country areas via satellite. These bush ISPs would be points of entry to
Australia, so they'd need to implement the ABA's secret blacklist -- But
with their small customer base, they're the ones least able to afford the
resources necessary to implement the Government's policy.
<p>The effect of this legislation will be to obliterate small and medium
businesses running ISP services from the cities, leaving Telstra and Optus
as duopoly providers. In the bush, Internet services will be lost totally,
as small providers simply cease to exist because doing business under the
threat of criminal sanctions for failing to do the impossible will be too
risky -- Country citizens, already forced to pay exorbitant Internet access
fees over poor-quality Telstra lines, will be forced to pay even more for
access, since they will have no alternative but to call long-distance to
the cities.
<p>The Government cannot possibly not know this: The Internet Industry
has been very vocal in its representations to DCITA, the ABA and the OFLC
for many years. This has been the strong message of the entire industry:
Government-imposed content regulation will represent the end of the Internet
industry as we know it, and the end of Australia's opportunity to perform
an active role in the world's burgeoning Internet economy.
<p>Even if one assumes that ISPs with sufficient funds to adhere to the
legislation actually exist (which is doubtful -- even the Telstras of this
would find it unprofitably difficult), the legislation still attempts the
impossible. The legislation states that ISPs must not only block the specific
content dictated by the ABA, but also any content which is "substantially
similar" to the offending material. Any method that might be used to achieve
this remarkable endeavour exists solely in the mind of Senator Alston;
Perhaps he'd grace us with some of his computer networking expertise by
giving us all some seminars to illuminate his unique and special insights?
<p>There is no way to achieve compliance with an ABA take-down order which
demands the blocking of material "substantially similar" to the specific
material which should be taken down. If a purveyor of "controversial" material
wishes to make it available to Australians, he can move it to a different
address, run it over an encrypted network protocol, change his web server
to a different port number, set up "mirrors" of his site on as many other
parts of the Internet as he can reach -- All cheaply, all virtually instantaneously,
always one step ahead of the ABA. An ABA take-down order will never make
the slightest amount of difference to the material Australian adults can
access, but it will turn ISPs into criminals for not preventing the attempts.
<p>Senator Alston has been sucked-in by vendors of what is derisively known
as "censorware". Censorware vendors claim to be able to filter-out illegal
or offensive content by using advanced software, thereby protecting children
from things which might damage them. What Senator Alston doesn't know,
however, is that the only reason those companies are able to have any degree
of credibility whatsoever is because they regularly change their names
whenever their reputation starts impacting their sales.
<p>A wonderful example of this is "iFilter", which Senator Alston specifically
recommended on the John Laws programme in early April. iFilter's previous
name was "BESS", exposed at <a href="http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/BESS">http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/BESS</a>.
It is a piece of software which is trivially disabled by an end user (instructions
at <a href="http://www.peacefire.org/bypass/Proxy">http://www.peacefire.org/bypass/Proxy</a>),
and even when it isn't disabled it simply <i>doesn't work</i>.
<p>Censorware vendors uniformly claim that they employ people to individually
check Internet resources for legality and offensiveness before adding them
to the secret blacklist used by the software; However, in every case yet
examined, this claim has been proven to be manifestly false. Some censorware
vendors claim that they used advanced technology to scan the Internet for
material which meets some well-reasoned blocking criteria, but again, these
claims border on fraudulent advertising: To perform such an act would require
a revolutionary quantum leap in artificial intelligence technology, and
if such a leap were ever performed it'd be highly unlikely that it'd be
used for something as trivially wacky as surfing the net for porn.
<p>Automatic filtering software is the snake-oil of the Information Age,
as shown authoritatively and conclusively by <a href="http://www.censorware.net">http://www.censorware.net</a>.
It doesn't work; It has never worked; It will never work. The Internet
is simply too diverse, too large, too varied to categorize in any way that'd
be useful for content regulation. And the situation is getting worse for
the censorware vendors with each passing day: As the Internet continues
its exponential growth, they're categorizing less and less of it. At present
growth rates, there's no way a company making a piece of consumer software
for $49.95 can possibly keep up, yet that's precisely what these companies
claim to be doing.
<p>The rest of the world knows this -- Censorware was debunked as failed
technology by virtually everyone except the Australian Government two years
ago. As the Censorware Project's reports ably demonstrate, not only do
these products fail to block the kinds of content they should be blocking,
they also block a phenomenal amount of perfectly innocent material, ranging
from feminist sites to safe sex resources. Pages are usually blocked because
a piece of software has found a "bad" sequence of words and added the page
to the blacklist without human intervention -- The kind of electronic incompetence
that leads to things like a home page for a local soccer league being blocked
by CyberPatrol because it mentioned the words "under 15" (leading the software
to think it was paedophilia. See <a href="http://www.censorware.net/reports/cyberpatrol/ada-yoyo.html">http://www.censorware.net/reports/cyberpatrol/ada-yoyo.html</a>).
<p>The Act also specifies that the Industry must develop content rating
systems which can be used to block traffic. Senator Alston is presumably
referring to implementing rating schemes using something similar to PICS,
which has been developed with the assistance of many dollars and man-hours
from the ABA. PICS is another failed technology: Despite the grand plans
and claims from PICS proponents three years ago, virtually nobody uses
it and those that do use it put up with flawed implementations (see <a href="http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/pics">http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/pics</a>
for a historical viewpoint of what was intended contrasted against what
was actually achieved, and <a href="http://www.mrlizard.com/haley.html">http://www.mrlizard.com/haley.html</a>
for an expose of the fact that according to the RSACi PICS criteria, Alex
Haley's classic of literature, <i>Roots</i>, carries the same rating as
a $1.95 pornographic paperback called "Nazi Masters, Teen Sluts". PICS
doesn't work either).
<p>In review: The Government expects ISPs to remove and block Internet
content on pain of criminal sanctions, despite several years worth of promises
to do otherwise (some of which were made as recently early April). Because
the Internet has been designed specifically to thwart the kind of outages
produced by censorship, there are no technologies which can achieve what
ISPs will be forced to do, and there probably never will be (since nobody
is going to re-engineer the Internet on a world-wide scale simply to accommodate
the wrong-headed delusions of an Australian Federal Minister). Without
exception, those technologies which can deliver an approximation of the
ABA's demands don't actually work: Their approximation is a poor one at
best, they are easily defeated by a teenager with five minutes to spare,
they fail to block the overwhelming majority of "controversial" content,
and they inadvertently block vast swarths of the Internet which should
never be blocked.
<p>The Minister for Information Technology wishes Australia's Internet
Industry to bet their businesses on technologies which failed years ago.
It is this closed-minded attitude which will see Australia relegated to
the backwaters of the international online economy.
<p>Please try to understand the effect this legislation is having on the
Internet Industry: The Government is sending out press releases which effectively
say that members of the Internet Industry who don't support these laws
are in the same boat as child molesters. Meanwhile, the Internet Industry
is horribly, palpably aware of the fact that the laws are impossible to
comply with. There is an awful sense of fear in the industry at the moment
that the Government will be successful in getting these laws through, leading
to the destruction of the businesses that thousands of us have invested
years of our lives building.
<p>We also know that the Minister is fully aware of this -- He commissioned
the CSIRO to report on the matter, and they come forth with conclusions
which paint an all-too-clear picture of the impossibility and unworkability
of exactly the kinds of things his Bill demands. Rather than heeding the
advice of the report he specifically asked for, he ignored it because it
didn't say what he wanted to hear. So it isn't at all surprising that some
members of the industry are of the belief that the Minister isn't driven
by mere ignorance, but that he actually harbours real hatred for everything
the Internet stands for and wishes to destroy it.
<p>Would Australia Post survive if it was to be made criminally liable
for transmitting certain types of material? And would the Australian population
stand for it if the Government demanded that Australia Post intercept and
examine the contents of their mail? Yet this is exactly what the Government
is demanding from the Internet industry.
<h1>
Australia's Participation in the Online Economy</h1>
As covered elsewhere in this submission, content providers will be ill-advised
to use the resources of the Australian Internet industry if this bill passes.
There are already substantial incentives for Australians to use overseas
content hosting sites, including more favourable taxation, cheaper production
costs, cheaper online service charges, better exchange rates and better
reserves of bandwidth. The Government will hammer the final nail into the
coffin of the Australian content hosting industry, and drive content developers
off-shore to "follow the money."
<p>I personally know of people who will leave this country in protest if
this bill passes -- These are the kind of emotions Senator Alston has raised
with his ill-thought-out legislation. But people don't need to go to that
extent to kill Australia's online economy.
<p><a name="offshore">Australian users don't even know when the web sites they use move offshore
-- It can be done with absolutely no impact to customers in Australia whatsoever,
right down to the "domain name" used to access the site (it's a fallacy
to believe that a name ending in ".au" actually resides in Australia).
An Australian server can be given a new IP address and shipped to a friendlier
jurisdiction with virtually no interruption to service.
<p>The Government has seen other Australian industries move offshore, but
some industries remain in Australia because running a business offshore
is a difficult prospect and a potential regulatory nightmare at the mercy
of foreign governments. The Internet has no such barriers, however: A company's
registered office can be in Adelaide with its content hosted in California
in a .com.au domain name and there's absolutely no reason why Australian's
can't continue to access it, and no way for the ABA to assert jurisdiction
over the content of the site. It's really that simple.
<p>Some Australian ISPs already run overseas World Wide Web servers to
provide better performance to their customers. Putting <i>all</i> Australian
content on US servers is a natural next step.
<h1>
The Bill is Unnecessary</h1>
The Government seems determined to make a political point so that it can
put out a press release saying that it has done something to "protect the
children." As a result of that, it has ignored many years worth of attempts
by the Industry to point out that <i>parents</i> can already control what
their children can see without these laws. Additional censorship is not
only impossible, it's also unnecessary.
<p>The key to "protecting the children" is parental responsibility. The
Government would be aghast if a responsible parent allowed their child
to walk the streets of Kings Cross at night without supervision. MPs would
be justifiably incredulous because of the danger of drugs, violence and
molestation -- Yet the Government claims that it's perfectly reasonable
that children should be able to use the Internet without supervision, even
though it also claims that they're in danger of drugs, violence and molestation.
<p>We can't have it both ways. Either the danger of damage to a child warrants
parental supervision or it doesn't. Parents who abdicate their responsibility
and allow their child to come into harm from the Internet should receive
the same treatment they'd get if they allowed their child to wander Kings
Cross. The Internet is not a babysitter, and young children shouldn't be
permitted to access it without parental supervision. Teenagers should be
provided with a bit more lee-way, but only if the parent is satisfied that
they are sufficiently responsible. And if parents are supervising their
children, this Bill is useless.
<h1>
Erosion of Parental Responsibility</h1>
The Government is treating every parent in Australia as if they're singularly
incapable of bringing up their own children responsibly. Along with many
other Australians, I find that attitude patently offensive. Letters and
press releases from Senator Alston's office make it clear that is he aware
that products exist which can be used by parents to control their childrens'
net access, but that he thinks Australian parents are too stupid to work
out how to use them.
<p>Senator Alston seems to think that Australian parents are so irresponsible
and so ineffective that the only way to bring up children properly is to
impose strict controls on the material everyone in the country, including
adults, are permitted to view. The unprecedented scope of this breathtaking
invasion into the private home stuns the imagination of everyone I've been
able to talk to.
<p>Children themselves, the voters of tomorrow, also have good reason to
resent these intrusions. For years they have been demonized in the media,
painted as irresponsible louts stumbling through their lives as layabouts
and borderline criminals, causing trouble through their school years so
they can grow up and join the dole queues and leech off the rest of society
-- And whenever anyone in any position of influence talks about the Internet,
the topic eventually begins to center on the idea that children are sexual
deviants who would spend all day surfing the net for porn if the Government
wasn't there to bring them up. Is it any wonder that the teenagers of today
are reaching adulthood with such profound disrespect for the mass media
and the Federal Government?
<p>Anyone who has spent any significant amount of time with modern children
knows that those views are simply false. Children these days are, by and
large, imbued with a deep sense of responsibility, coming from the need
to grow up faster in our modern age. They know how to get vastly more value
out of the Internet than their parents do (and infinitely more than the
Minister for Information Technology does), and they use it to maximise
that value. They understand that they shouldn't give personal information
to strangers, they should be careful about who they talk to, and that they
should view information with skepticism until it is independently confirmed
-- Yet the Government insists on making the assumption that they're all
so amazingly stupid that they're in danger of being molested by a complete
stranger who doesn't even know where they are as soon as they're allowed
on-line without supervision.
<p>The Internet is infinitely safer than the streets of our cities; Yet
children routinely take public transport to and from school without supervision.
For some bizarre reason, the Government seems to think that these very
same teenagers will be in mortal peril if they're allowed to get onto the
net once they get home -- apparently even if their parents are there to
watch them (remember, these regulations affect adults too). I cannot even
begin to imagine how the Minister has reached the conclusions that have
driven him to believe the fantasy that his regulations will "protect the
children," because (a) they won't actually restrict any material on the
net at all, and (b) there isn't a significant threat to protect them from
in the first place.
<p>If a child is incapable of looking after themselves on the net by the
time they're in their teens, then the parent has failed in their mission
to bring up the child -- it's that simple. We permit children to have sex
and drive a car at 16 years old, and assume the full mantle of adulthood
by the time they're 18, yet the Government's controls exist as a failed
attempt to keep teenagers wrapped-up in cotton-wool until they've reached
the age where they're expected to look after themselves. How are they to
understand the life they'll be thrown into at age 18 if they've been legally
excluded from it until the moment of their birthday?
<p>Children who are truly too young to understand and deal with the content
of the Internet should be supervised by their parents at all times. This
is simple to enforce: Internet access requires a password, and there's
no requirement whatsoever for the parent to provide that password to their
children. By attempting to make the Internet "safe" for very young children
the Government is actually advocating bad parenting by sending the message
that it's alright to use a piece of software to bring up your children.
<p>Parents need control. This Bill erodes that control by dragging it back
into the realm of the Federal Government and making it a criminal offense
for parents to decide to wrest control back (by prohibiting them from using
an ISP who isn't victimized by ABA filtering controls).
<h1>
Australians Object to Censorship</h1>
When asked, Australians almost unanimously reject censorship. Some recent
polls which spring to mind include:
<ul>
<li>
A poll by the <i>Sunday</i> programme on Sunday 25th April 1999, which
posed the question, "Which of the following are you most concerned about?
Sex and nudity on television? Violence on television? Senators telling
us what we can watch?"</li>

<br>The results of the poll: 4% of respondents said they were concerned
about sex, 12% said they were concerned about violence, and 84% said they
were concerned about Senators telling us what we can watch.
<br>The message is clear: Australia's ever-creeping censorship legislation
has gone too far, and ordinary voting Australians resent it.
<li>
A <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/970425/nsp3.txt.htm">poll</a>
by The Age in April 1997 showed that <i>"...83 per-cent of Australians
thought that non-violent sexually explicit X-rated videos should be legally
available."</i> This was at a time when the matter was high in the public's
mind due to efforts to ban them, and the result of the poll shows the lack
of respect freedom-loving Australians have for censorship attempts by their
governments.</li>

<li>
A phone-in session on ABC Radio National in October 1998 featured a discussion
with an ABA official about Internet content regulation followed by a talkback.
The programme took ten calls from all over Australia during the duration
of the broadcast, and the calls were unanimously against Governmental censorship
of the Internet.</li>

<br>A follow-up programme later in the week took more calls, and was once
again inundated by callers objecting to the efforts of the Federal Government
to control what they can see and what they can publish. Throughout both
programmes, not one caller approved of content regulation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
The legislation is manifestly unpopular. Most people agree with the idea
of keeping certain types of material away from unsupervised children, but
when the method the Government wishes to use to achieve that goal is explained,
even the staunchest advocates of child protection waver and agree that
the Bill is wrong. The Government is ploughing ahead with this with the
arrogant attitude that it knows best and that the "solution" it has found
for the the "problem" is the only rational way to go.
<p>But the Government is wrong.
<p>As the US Federal Court found in its 1996 landmark ruling in <i>ACLU
v. Reno</i> (later affirmed by the US Supreme Court), the Internet is <i>"...
the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed",</i> and, <i>"The
plaintiffs in these actions correctly describe the `democratizing' effects
of Internet communication: individual citizens of limited means can speak
to a worldwide audience on issues of concern to them."</i> Because of this
world-wide participation in democratic principles of free speech, the Internet
in its present form is precisely the kind of media that appeals to Australians.
Yet the Government wishes to destroy those principles, trampling them in
the name of some unspecified and undemonstrated danger to our children,
which, even if it existed, could be better fought by encouraging responsible
parenting.
<p>Every Australian should feel a deep sense of betrayal at the treatment
we are experiencing at the hands of Senator Alston over this bill; And
I firmly believe that if the bill passes, and Australians see the future
of their country in the Information Age evaporate and their freedom of
speech in the 21st century's most important communications medium evaporate
out from underneath them, they will feel every last nuance of that betrayal
for a very long time.
<h1>
Summary</h1>
This bill is <i>wrong</i> -- There is no other word to describe it. It
criminalizes an industry that is supposed to be formed around a core of
common carriers, it destroys freedom of speech, it will obliterate entire
industries, it will damage the economic basis of the future of this country,
and it will turn Australia into the laughing stock of the Internet community
("Oh, you can't get that email to him, it'll get stopped by the Australia-filter!
What a joke!"). As a result of Senator Alston's efforts, I have found myself
embarrassed to call myself an Australian in certain online forums over
the last few months, as if the association I have with him simply by being
in the same country is having a negative impact on my reputation. I know
this will only get worse if the Bill passes into law.
<p>Australia is presently the only western democratic nation in the world
going ahead with content controls -- that alone should demonstrate how
wrong-headed these moves are. To compound matters, the content regulation
is based on ideas which were tried and found to be lacking years ago, and
no amount of wooly-headed optimism from Senator Alston will prevent them
from lacking in future.
<p>Malaysia, usually viewed as a censorious nation, announced that it was
abandoning its content control regime in March 1999 on the grounds that
the regime was directly responsible for extremely slow uptake of the Malaysian
online services industry.
<p>Yet that's the future Senator Alston has in store for us.
<p>Singapore also uses content controls, but they are routinely bypassed
and authorities don't seem to mind. Like the Malaysians, they accept that
filtering the Internet is a recipe for failure because it is technologically
impossible, and like the Malaysians they turn a blind eye to violations
as long as they're discrete violations. In Singapore, it's more important
to <i>have</i> the law than to vigourously enforce it.
<p>In the United States, censorware vendors continue their name-change
dance. What's known as "BESS" today is "iFilter" tomorrow; "X-Stop Felony
Load" today becomes "Librarian II" tomorrow. Other companies are more subtle
by contracting manufacturers to embed their product in network devices
without referring to it by name at all, which is why so many corporate
firewall products contain an embedded version of "CyberPatrol". Changing
or obscuring their name is the only way these companies can maintain credibility,
as each of their old names becomes tarnished by the negative publicity
generated when people work out that the product doesn't even come close
to performing as advertised. Seth Finkelstein wrote for the Censorware
Project:
<blockquote>"So another censorware product has been found to have secretly
been blacklisting gay and lesbian material, anti-censorship sites, feminist
resources and an incomprehensible scattershot collection of totally innocuous
organizations. We can treat this as yet another 'bad apple' in the endless
search for the magic anti-porn program. Or we can use it as a basis for
examining why such a program won't ever exist.
<p>"A censorware blacklist seems to enjoy the enviable status of being
assumed perfect until exposed as otherwise. Even though CyberSitter and
NetNanny were caught banning the National Organization for Women, and CyberPatrol
stigmatizes feminist discussion and electronic newspaper articles about
gays as 'Sexual Acts', every new expose of this type seems to follow a
pattern. First, it is greeted with great surprise (and denial) by too many
people. Then the company's public relations staff issues a weasel-worded
press release of excuses. Finally, later, we are told that that particular
program may have problems, but there's another one which is better, and
the cycle begins anew.</blockquote>
... and so the cycle continues in Australia.
<p>I converse regularly by email with individuals in many countries. One
person I spoke to recently described a plan he has to make money out of
Australians by charging them to access a server he will run which will
bypass Australian filtering restrictions. There is no technological way
to combat something like that short of cutting off the entire country's
Internet access, so as Australians become more and more frustrated by the
poor performance they're receiving and the missing chunks of the Internet
they can no longer view, they'll know that for just a few dollars per month
charged to their credit card they can use his service and never worry about
stupid Australian content controls again. He'll probably make a ton of
money at the expense of ordinary Australians, just one more way that the
money in Australia's Internet industry will move off-shore.
<p>The pornographers aren't asleep at the switch either. They are developing
a system which will permit them offer service to Australians by changing
their network addresses every time they get added to an Australian blacklist.
It'll be a matter of "Now you don't see me -- Now you do!" and will trivially
frustrate any attempt by the Australian Government to restrict access to
those sites.
<p>The Government is doomed to fail in its attempts to regulate the Internet
- It's too late, it should have started 20 years ago. The Government is
now trying to squeeze the free speech toothpaste back into the censorship
tube. If there was ever a war to fight, the Australian Government has already
lost it, and it's high time it realized that and stopped fighting.
<p>It is an article of faith that members of parliament are not computer
network experts. The Internet Industry has attempted to educate the Minister
over the last few years -- We've tried to explain how trivially simple
it is to move content offshore without interruption to service and without
increased cost to the consumer or provider; We've tried to explain that
censorship is a technical impossibility; We've tried to explain that good
parenting actually <i>does</i> work. We've tried to point out the breadth
of destruction that will be wrought on our nascent industry in the event
of ill-advised legislation... The Minister is fully aware of everything
I've said in this submission, it hasn't made any difference.
<p>I call upon this Select Committee to condemn this bill in the strongest
possible terms. Even in an amended form it will bring untold havoc onto
the Internet Industry, nipping Australia's Information Age future off at
the bud. The Bill must not be permitted to pass.
<p>Yours truthfully,
