<h3>Parking</h3>
<P> 
If you are renting a car (Note: that the Pyle Center is approx 0.7 miles from the Concourse Hotel) recommended parking is located at the Lake Street Parking Lot, 2 short blocks from the Pyle Center, at a cost of approximately $10.00/day.  For registrants staying at the Concourse Hotel, buses will be provided on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday between the Concourse Hotel and The Pyle Center.   We would recommend you use this where possible as Madison can get congested in the rush hour and there is currently some construction in the area.</P>

<P>The City of Madison has parking ramps and limited metered street parking within a short walk of both The Lowell Center and The Pyle Center. Space in these areas cannot be reserved. Public parking on campus ( <a href="http://www.civc.wisc.edu/gettingAround.php">http://www.civc.wisc.edu/gettingAround.php</a> ) is operated by the UW. These lots are often full by 10 am weekdays, but some have limited visitor permits.</p>
