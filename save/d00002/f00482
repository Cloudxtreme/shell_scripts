<div class="pagetitle">Debian and grsec kernel on NETGEAR ReadyNAS 102</div><br/>

<p>This page documents some efforts to get a recent grsec-enabled
  kernel and latest Debian system running on NETGEAR ReadyNAS 102,
  instead of the original (Marvell/NETGEAR-patched) kernel and custom
  system. The final goal is to have kernel patches pushed upstream;
  check Changelog and Todo list below to see current status and
  progresses. <a href="../NAS/index.html"></a>This is the same kind of
  work I previously performed for Netgear ReadyNAS Duo v2</a>.</p>

<p>As the platform are very similar and I already spent quite some
  time documenting Duo v2 hardware, only the main differences are
  given here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Duo v2 is powered by a single core Marvell Kirkwood 88F6282
  ARMv5TE CPU runinng at 1.6GHz when the 102 is powered by a Marvell
  Armada 370 ARMv7 CPU running at 1.2GHz. <b>The latter has NX
  support</b>.</li>
<li>The Duo v2 has 256MB of DDR3 RAM, the 102 comes with 512MB (2 Hynix
  H5TQ2G83DFRH9C chips).</li> 
<li>Both devices have 1 front USB2.0 port and 2 rear USB3.0 ports. The
  102 also comes with a rear eSATA port.</li> 
<li>The USB3.0 controller of the Duo v2 is a NEC/RENESAS ÂµPD720200 USB
  3.0 Host Controller when the 102 includes a Fresco Logic
  FL1009-2Q0.</li>  
<li>The Duo v2 and the 102 both have a GMT G762 Fan controller and a
  Protechnic 91mm MGT9212YB-025 fan. </li>
<li>The RTC and alarm chip of the Duo v2 is a Ricoh RS5C32A while the
  one in the 102 is an Intersil ISL12057.</li>
<li>Both devices includes 128MB of NAND (1 Hynix H27U1G8F2BTR).</li>
</ul>


<a name="changelog"></a>
<h3> Changelog i.e. work done </h3>

<ul>
<li> <u>May 2013:</u> added information on serial console pins. Got
  first custom running kernel on the device (3.10-rc1) using a basic
  custom .dts file. Work on improving initial .dts file to support
  more hardware parts (LED, buttons, ...).</li>
<li> <u>April 2013:</u> Created the page. First pictures of hardware
  parts. First connection via 3.3V serial console (available under the
  sticker at the rear of the NAS). Started splitting NETGEAR/Marvell
  patch above 3.0.56 kernel (1.1 million lines).</li>
</ul>

<a name="todo-list"></a>
<h3> Todo list i.e. work in progress </h3>

<ul>
<li> <s>Get an initial .dts file capable of booting a userland</s> </li>
<li> <s>Add entries for gpio LEDs in .dts file </s> </li>
<li> <s>Add entries for gpio buttons in .dts file </s> </li>
<li> Find which GPIO activity LED is using </li>

  integration)</li>
<li> Debug the issue w/ the ethernet PHY not been recognized</li>
<li> Understand if current kernels can support NAND </li>
</ul>

<h3> Marvell Armada 370 </h3>

<p>The ReadyNAS 102 is powered by an
  (ARMv7-based) <a href="refs/Marvell_ARMADA_370_SoC.pdf">Marvell
  ARMADA 370</a> SoC. The CPU comes with a FPU and NX bit support. The
  SoC includes a 16-bit DDR3 memory interface, two ethernet MAC
  controllers (one routed on the 102), two DMA/XOR engines, a network
  security engine, two UART interfaces, thermal support, etc. The
  following Armada 370 SoC block diagrams (extracted from the product
  brief) provides an overview of supported functionalities:</p>

<img src="pics/armada370-soc-block-diagram.jpg">

<p> The following excerpt (also fro the product brief) provides an
  expected typical use of the SoC in 2 bay NAS implementations: </p>

<img src="pics/armada370-soc-typical-nas-implem.jpg">

<p> The ReadyNAS 102 uses this architecture with some additional
  hardware parts to support more functionalities (specific RTC with
  alarm support, USB 3.0, eSATA controller, etc) </p>

<h3> Intersil ISL12057 I<sup>2</sup>C bus RTC </h3>

<p> The RaedyNAS 102 comes with an Intersil ISL12057 I<sup>2</sup>C
  bus RTC chip, as depicted below. </p>

<!-- <img src="pics/thumbs/RN102_Intersil_ISL12057_thumb.jpg"> -->

<p> The Intersil ISL 12057 is a low power RTC and Alarm chip. Support
  for the chip is not yet available in current mainline kernel (3.8 at
  the time of writing) but a short patch (596 LoC) has been written
  by NETGEAR for the ReadyNAS 102 kernel (based on 3.0.56). The same
  kind of work I did for G762 fan controller for NETGEAR ReadyNAS Duo
  v2 could also be done for this driver in order to make it available
  in mainline kernel. Here is <a href="refs/ISL12057.pdf">a local copy
  of the ISL12057 datasheet</a>.</p>

  FL1009, as depicted below. A product brief is locally
  cached <a href="refs/Fresco_Logic_Product_Brief_FL1000_FL1009.pdf">here</a>.
  The FL1009 is a 2-port PCIe, which was the first one to gain USB-IF

<li>The main daughter board supports all the rear connector of the
  device, i.e. the two USB ports, the eSata port, the ethernet, the
  fan connector and the serial console pins.</li> 
<li>The second daughter board holds the two SATA connectors for the
  disks. </li>
