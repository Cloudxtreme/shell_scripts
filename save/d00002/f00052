<A HREF="http://www.etn.nl/" target="link">European Travel Network</A> has an extremely cluttered web

In March 2001 they sent mail to me which looked to me to be spam,
they swear that I'd left the address they spammed with a fare info
request on their site a year earlier.
I find that very hard to believe, both because I don't recall visiting
their site at all in 2000, and because the address they spammed isn't
one that I'd have used there.

<p><BR /><STRONG>PLEASE NOTE:</STRONG>
I am not a travel agent, just an interested traveller.
Everything I know about on-line travel info is in this FAQ.  Don't write or
call me asking for fare quotes, packages, or any other travel agent info,
because I don't have it.</p>
