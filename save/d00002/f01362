       Release of FreeBSD 9.0 Delivers More Power to Serve
    </h1>
    <h2>
       Today, the FreeBSD Foundation announced the recent release of 
       FreeBSD 9.0. FreeBSD  9.0-RELEASE raises the bar for open source 
       operating systems in terms of file system reliability, IPv6-readiness, 
       networking capabilities, compiler and toolchain technologies, and security.
    </h2>

    <p>
       Boulder, CO January 26, 2012-Today, the FreeBSD Foundation announced 
       the recent release of FreeBSD 9.0. FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE raises the bar 
       for open source operating systems in terms of file system reliability, 
       IPv6-readiness, networking capabilities, compiler and toolchain technologies, 
       and security. Many of its new features directly benefit system 
       administrators, application developers, and companies that use or base 
       their products on FreeBSD.    
    </p>

    <p>
       "FreeBSD 9.0 represents the culmination of over two years of ground-breaking 
       work in operating system performance, reliability, and security," said Ken 
       Smith, Release Engineer for the FreeBSD Project. "We are proud to dedicate 
       this release to the memory of Dennis M. Ritchie, one of the founding fathers 
       of the UNIX&#174; operating system, whose vision and work laid the foundations for 
       FreeBSD."
    </p>

    <p>
       Filesystem changes in this release provide great benefits to both UFS and ZFS 
       users. When installing with UFS, softupdates journaling (UFS+SUJ) is automatically
       enabled. UFS+SUJ uses an intent log which safely eliminates the need for a long
       filesystem check and recovery process, even after an unclean shutdown.
    </p>
    <p>
       ZFS has been updated to version 28 which supports data deduplication, triple parity
       RAIDZ3, snapshot holds, log device removal, zfs diff, zpool split, zpool import -F, 
       and read-only zpool import.
    </p>

    <p>
      FreeBSD 9.0 also introduces the Highly Available STorage (HAST) framework which 
      provides transparent storage of the same data across several systems connected 
      by a TCP/IP network. In combination with other high availability features of FreeBSD 
      like the CARP fail-over protocol, HAST makes it possible to build a highly available 
      storage cluster that is resistant to hardware failures. 
    </p>

    <p>
     Continuing its heritage of innovating in the area of security research, FreeBSD 9.0 
     introduces Capsicum. Capsicum is a lightweight framework which extends a POSIX UNIX 
     kernel to support new security capabilities and adds a userland sandbox API. Originally
     developed as a collaboration between the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory 
     and Google and sponsored by a grant from Google, FreeBSD was the prototype platform and
     Chromium was the prototype application. FreeBSD 9.0 provides kernel support as an 
     experimental feature for researchers and early adopters. Application support will 
     follow in a later FreeBSD release and there are plans to provide some initial Capsicum-
     protected applications in FreeBSD 9.1.
    </p>

    <p>
    "Google is excited to see the award-winning Capsicum work incorporated in FreeBSD 9.0, 
     bringing native capability security to mainstream UNIX for the first time," said Ulfar 
     Erlingsson, Manager, Security Research at Google.
    </p>

    <p>
     FreeBSD has been been an early adopter and active participant in the IPv6 community since 
     FreeBSD 4.0 was released in 2000 with the KAME reference implementation of IPv4/IPv6 networking 
     support. In addition, the FreeBSD Project has been serving releases from IPv6-enabled servers 
     for more than 8 years and FreeBSD's website, mailing lists, and developer infrastructure have 
     been IPv6-enabled since 2007. FreeBSD 9.0 introduces IPv6-only snapshots which completely remove 
     IPv4 from the operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
     2012 has been called the 'year of IPv6' and "the FreeBSD project is well positioned to be one of 
     the leaders in IPv6-Only  validation work," stated Bjoern Zeeb, member of the FreeBSD Release 
     Engineering Team and recipient of the 2010 Itojun Service Award for his significant improvements 
     in open source implementations of IPv6. "The growing usage of FreeBSD's IPv6 networking stack by 
     appliance builders, integration of a more flexible interface configuration, and the implementation 
     of new standards such as Secure Neighbor Discovery, DNS Options for Router Advertisements, and CPE 
     Requirements, makes FreeBSD 9.0 the perfect open source operating system to build your IPv6 deployments 
     and products on."
    </p>
    
    <p>
   Other new features include:
    </p>
    
     <ul>
     <li>userland DTrace has been added to supplement kernel-level DTrace</li>
     <li>the FreeBSD world and kernel can now be compiled using the BSD-licensed LLVM toolchain</li>
     <li>resource limit actions can be applied to processes, users, login classes, and jails</li>
     <li>the addition of a pluggable congestion framework and five new TCP congestion control algorithms</li>
     <li>HPN-SSH is enabled by default and increases transfer speeds on long, high bandwidth network links</li>
     <li>NFSv4 support added</li>
     <li>flattened device trees (FDT) allows for hardware resource enumeration and simplifies configuration 
         on embedded platforms</li>
     </ul>

     <p>
