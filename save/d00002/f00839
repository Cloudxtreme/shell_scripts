<h2><a name="Letter">Letter From the President</a></h2>
<h3>
  <p>This One Goes to Eleven</p>
  <img src="/assets/goes_to_eleven.jpg" alt="Nigel's Amp" WIDTH=503 HEIGHT=283>
</h3>

<p>
FreeBSD has a flourishing community.  Innovative technology is
packed into every release.  Thousands of products and services the
world relies upon are built on FreeBSD, and the adoption rate of
FreeBSD accelerates year after year.  By all of these measures,
FreeBSD is an amazingly successful open source project.  But at the
FreeBSD Foundation, we know today's success is just a step on a
long path.  We constantly ask, "How can we make FreeBSD even better?"
"How can we take FreeBSD up that 'extra notch'?" Or as Nigel from
'This is Spinal Tap' would put it, "If we're playing maxed out at
ten, how do we take it to eleven?"
</p>

<p>
Our answer for the 2013 year is to redefine the way the FreeBSD
Foundation supports FreeBSD.  Every year since I started the FreeBSD
Foundation, we have grown our budget and activities by 10 to 25%,
all managed by a single part-time employee.  This next year we are
investing in staff.  Staff to bolster FreeBSD's amazing community
of volunteers.  Staff to scale the FreeBSD Foundation's funded
development initiatives.  Staff to double our capabilities in a
single year.
</p>

<p>
This plan will increase the number and size of the development
projects we fund.  However, it is the FreeBSD Foundation's investment
in "human infrastructure" that I believe will yield the largest
dividends.  As a volunteer myself, I know that no matter how deep
my love for FreeBSD is, family and my "day job" must come first.
Even with these other priorities, the volunteers that maintain the
project's computer clusters, handle security incidents, tend our
revision control and bug tracking systems, and generate our releases,
show amazing skill and awe inspiring dedication.  But our pool of
volunteers for these areas hasn't grown as quickly as the rest of
the project.  By adding paid staff to support these roles, we will
help reduce burn-out, provide continuity, and increase the effectiveness
of FreeBSD's volunteers.
</p>

<p>
If things go as expected, by the end of 2013, the FreeBSD Foundation
will have five employees, and an annual budget approaching $750,000.
It will be a challenging transition, but a necessary step on the
path of FreeBSD's continued success.  Please consider giving us
your support while we work to take FreeBSD all the way to eleven!

<h2><a name="Fundraising">Fundraising Update</a></h2>
<p>
Wow. I’ve been thoroughly overwhelmed by the outpouring of donations
over the last few weeks! As of this publication we have raised
$460,000 towards our goal of $500,000.
</p>

<p>
I want to thank you for everything you do to make this the best
operating system around. There wouldn’t be a FreeBSD if we didn’t
have you writing code, writing documentation, working on ports and
releases, and educating current and future FreeBSD users.
</p>

<p>
We haven’t met our target yet, but we are getting close.  Historically,
each year, we have been half way to our fundraising goal at the
start of December. Going forward, this is something that we plan
on changing.
</p>

<p>
We unintentionally received some interesting press that disturbed a
lot of FreeBSD users. This encouraged over 950 donations to come
in, this past week. All I can say, is that it was incredible to see
this support. One donor commented, “I don't use FreeBSD yet, but
I've heard good things about the project, so that's why I wanted
to support you.” How cool is that?
</p>

<p>
Your donations help us fund projects to improve FreeBSD, sponsor
conferences and summits, purchase equipment to build infrastructure,
promote FreeBSD, and provide legal counsel for the Project. In
short, it helps us to provide the funding to make this the best OS
available.
</p>

<p>
We’ve received some great lessons during this campaign. One thing
we learned is that we need to advertise our fundraising needs outside
of our FaceBook page, blog, and the FreeBSD Announce mailing list.
</p>

<p>
I hope that as you read through some of our accomplishments this year,
you will consider
<a href="/donate/">making a donation</a>
to the Foundation. We can’t do it without you!

<h2><a name="Projects">Development Project Updates</a></h2>
<p>
<h3><a name="Project1">Efika SmartBook/SmartTop FreeBSD ARM Port</a></h3>

<p>
Tired of burning yourself with your laptop?  If so, maybe it’s time
for a change, such as switching to a platform that doesn’t require a
large heat sink or loud cooling fans.
</p>

<p>
It is now possible to run FreeBSD on a low power, ARM-based, laptop:
the <a href="http://www.genesi-tech.com/products/smartbook">Genesi 
Efika MX Smartbook</a>. It has an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU inside,
and, just like a cell phone, is energy efficient, consumes minimal
power and uses passive cooling.
</p>

<p>
Our main project goal is to implement the missing pieces for the
Freescale ARM SoC, including graphics, and to provide a great example
of FreeBSD running on a low power device that developers can both
use, and show off.
</p>

<p>
With the Efika MX code in the tree, we will have support for ARM-based
laptops and even nettops (such as the Efika MX Smartop model) and
we can continue pushing FreeBSD into ARM tablets and other ARM-based
devices.

<p>
<h3><a name="Project2">Capsicum Component Framework</a></h3>
</p>

<p>
Capsicum is a novel hybrid capability model that first appeared in
FreeBSD 9.0, targeted at application compartmentalization: the
mitigation of security vulnerabilities through decomposition of
complex and risky applications into isolated components.
</p>

<p>
In the big picture, Capsicum provides a tight sandboxing mechanism
where access to all global name spaces is restricted, and also
allows actions that can be performed on file descriptors to be
limited (file descriptors represent capabilities).
</p>

<p>
The purpose of my project was to make Capsicum more mature as well
as easier to use by application developers.
</p>

<p>
The main part of the project was to create the Casper daemon, which
is used by sandboxed processes to gain access to functionality that
is not directly permitted within a sandbox.  As an example, Casper
provides a DNS service which can be use by sandboxed processes for
host name resolution without the need to read /etc/resolv.conf or
send any network packets to DNS servers.
</p>

<p>
Another part of the project was to remove capability wrapping
descriptors - a special kind of file descriptors with a limited set
of rights (e.g. a file descriptor which can be used only for reading,
but not writing, fchmod, etc.). The capability wrapping descriptors
were replaced with the ability to limit rights on any regular
descriptor.  This simplifies much of Capsicum's kernel support code
and makes sandboxing more robust.
</p>

<p>
Initially the ioctl(2) system call was denied in capability mode
(i.e. for sandboxed processes), because of its huge scope. Now, it
is possible to limit the ioctl commands that can be performed within
a sandbox, on a given descriptor.  I also added the ability to
control fcntl operations in a similar fashion.
</p>

<p>
Many bugs were fixed, many smaller improvements were made, and a
lot of new regression tests were created along the way.
</p>

<p>
Capsicum is still on-going work, but thanks to funding from the
FreeBSD Foundation and Google, it is maturing quickly and is starting
to be used in real world applications (I personally use it in my
other, FreeBSD Foundation sponsored, projects: HAST and auditdistd).

<p>
<h3><a name="Project3">iSCSI Target</a></h3>
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to create a native, high performance,
iSCSI target facility for FreeBSD.  While configuration and connection
setup and teardown are handled by a userland daemon, unlike previous
target frameworks, all data-movement is performed in the kernel.
The iSCSI target is fully integrated with the CAM Target Layer
meaning that volumes can be backed by files or any block device.
The hardware offload capabilities of modern network adapters will
also be supported.
</p>

<p>
Much of the protocol and data movement logic can be shared between
iSCSI target and initiator implementations.  Once target support
is robust, FreeBSD's existing iSCSI initiator will be updated to
use many of the components developed for the target.  This will
improve initiator performance and add modern features such as
InitialR2T.
<p>

<p>
The project is quickly progressing from a working prototype to a
fully functional state; testing phase is expected to start in early
January.  After that the development will focus on implementing the
hardware offload and performance tuning.

<!-- Conferences and Travel Grants -->

<h2><a name="Conferences">Conference Updates</a></h2>

<h3><a name="EuroBSDCon">EuroBSDCon 2012</a></h3>

<p>
In October 2012, the 11th EuroBSDcon was held in the beautiful city
of Warsaw in Poland. Four days of talking, learning about BSD, and
of course exploring Polish culture (don't forget the Polish Hussars).
The conference featured 2 tutorial days followed by two conference
days on Saturday and Sunday. The conference consisted of a 2 track
program, paralleled by a devsummit track on Saturday.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, EuroBSDcon has a strong FreeBSD presence, but there
is also enough room for the other BSD's. One of the reasons for the
strong FreeBSD presence is the FreeBSD devsummit, which is held
concurrently with the EuroBSDcon tutorial days.
</p>

<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation has been one of the regular sponsors over
the years.  This support plays an important role in making this an
outstanding conference.
</p>

<p>
Besides sponsoring the conference, The FreeBSD Foundation also
provides travel grants for visitors and developers who can not
afford to go the conference on their own. This gives them the
opportunity to visit the conference and exchange knowledge and ideas
with other conference attendees, which greatly improves the value
of having such conferences.
</p>

<p>
We are excited to announce that EuroBSDcon 2013 will be held September
28th-29th, 2013 (tutorials will be September 26th-27th) on Malta
(St. Julian's area).

<h3><a name="DevSummit">Cambridge Developer Summit 2012</a></h3>
<p>
Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of co-organizing the Cambridge
DevSummit. Robert Watson, in contrast, had most of the stress, and
others had the fun of running around and actually doing the work.
This was a three-day event, with a documentation summit scheduled
for the day before, organized primarily by Gavin Atkinson and Isabell
Long.
</p>

<p>
This was the second such event hosted in Cambridge; the first in
which no one fell in the river—possibly because the weather wasn't
quite nice enough to encourage punting that week.
</p>

<p>
The three days of the main event were split into three sessions,
with two tracks in each. I invited some visitors from ARM (who,
conveniently, are just down the road) to attend one afternoon
session. This was productive, and led to further engagement between
the FreeBSD community and ARM.  ARM is a customer-focused company,
and those who may be interested in FreeBSD/ARM are potential customers
of ARM's customers.
</p>

<p>
We finalized the schedule on the first day, filling an entire
whiteboard with items that two or more people wanted to discuss and
then splitting into groups. While a bit more advanced planning may
have been helpful, our strategy worked relatively well this year.
A short summary from each of the groups was presented in the final
session and then published on the FreeBSD wiki.
</p>

<p>
The toolchain session, a big session, was of particular interest
to me. We arrived at a tentative plan for throwing the switch to
make clang the default compiler on FreeBSD-CURRENT. This was further
discussed on the mailing list, and has now happened, bringing us
one big step closer to a GPL-free FreeBSD 10.
</p>

<p>
An afternoon of short talks from researchers in the Cambridge
Computer Lab involved either operating systems work in general or
FreeBSD in particular. Robert Watson showed off a tablet running
FreeBSD on a MIPS-compatible soft-core processor running on an
Altera FPGA.
</p> 

<p>
Cambridge, an old university town, predates the invention of hills
and so is very amenable to cycling. We hired bikes for all non-local
developers so they could get around easily.
</p>

<p>
The DevSummit dinner was hosted by St. John's College and cosponsored
by Google and the FreeBSD Foundation. This enjoyable event, in the
historic surroundings of a 500-year old college, provided a unique
(and possibly never-to-be-repeated) opportunity of seeing a group
of FreeBSD developers smartly dressed.
</p>

<p>
The day after the conference, Ollivier Robert organized a trip to
Bletchley Park, which this year was celebrating Turing's centenary.
Although it was an informative outing, I don't believe that it
resulted in any concrete plans for a FreeBSD/Collossus port.

<h3><a name="VendorSummit">Bay Area Vendor Summit 2012</a></h3>

<p>
On November 8th The FreeBSD Foundation sponsored the FreeBSD Silicon
Valley Vendor Summit.  The summit was hosted by Yahoo at their
Sunnyvale campus.  We had over 50 participants from more than 20
different companies participate in the summit, which is a great
turnout.
</p>

<p>
After a round of introductions we discussed the work that had been
completed since the last summit, in May of 2012, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Altera IP core drivers</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 work</li>
<li>Comprehensive test framework (ATF)</li>
<li>DTrace on non-x86 (MIPS)</li>
<li>Intel graphics</li>
<li>Ivy Bridge hwpmc</li>
<li>clang/llvm MIPS</li>
<li>ZFS improvements</li>
<li>growfs on live fs</li>
</ul>

<p>
After going over the completed and still to be done items, we had a
brief set of comments from Tom Hanrahan of Microsoft on HyperV
support for FreeBSD.  Microsoft's intention is to have full hypervisor
support for FreeBSD and they are actively engaging with the community
to get the proper drivers in the right places in our tree so that
FreeBSD is a first class citizen in their system.
</p>

<p>
The first major presentation of the day was Jim Harris talking about
VTune.  VTune is a system to help developers understand the performance
of their code.  A small number of us have been working with Intel
to get this software available on FreeBSD, as, at the moment, it
is only available on Windows and Linux.
</p>

<p>
VTune includes two major components, a data collector and a
visualization program.  The collector has been ported to FreeBSD
and is available as a pre-beta to interested developers.  The
visualization program continues to only be available on Windows and
Linux, but since the collector and the visualizer are separate it
is easy to collect information about programs, including the kernel,
running on a FreeBSD host and display the results on another system.
One feature that VTune continues to lack, but which Intel is working
on, is support for call graphs.  Right now the system can show you
which line of code is causing a performance problem, which is quite
useful, but it does not show the call graph, basically how your
program happened to get to that point.  This is a feature that Intel
knows it needs on FreeBSD for the system to be completely accepted
by vendors and other folks building high performance systems with
FreeBSD.  That being said, it's still an impressive piece of software
and will definitely help people who care about performance tuning.
</p>

<p>
Jim says that those who are interested in using VTune in its current
form should contact him directly to get ahold of the beta driver:
Jim Harris <jimharris@freebsd.org>.  I've put up a "VTune How To"
page on our <a href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/VTune">Wiki</a>
and will be populating it over the next week.
</p>

<p>
After the morning break Adrian Chadd brought people up to date on
what's going on with embedded systems and FreeBSD.  There has been
a good deal of progress here, in particular the work done recently
on ARM processor support, with FreeBSD now running on several
systems, including the BeagelBone, ShivaPlug, and the now ubiquitous
Raspberry Pi.  MIPS support continues to improve, with a significant
chunk of work coming from the folks in Cambridge, as well as companies
that are integrating FreeBSD on MIPS into their products.  PowerPC
is also moving along, although there remains a dearth of hardware
on which to work.  A good deal of discussion accompanied this
section, in particular about what we need to do to get the rest of
the system, i.e. ports and packages, up on these architectures.
Here the story is also improving with a set of packages existing
for ARM processors as well.  People interested in this area should
check out recent mail threads on arm@ and embedded@ as well as
others.
</p>

<p>
After talking about embedded systems, Daichi Goto updated us on
efforts with vendors in Japan.  He and Hiroki Sato have been busy
working with companies in Japan and have set up a BSD Consulting
company which is working with large Japanese companies to build
business services on top of FreeBSD, with a great deal of success.
Other work they're doing includes getting a good deal of FreeBSD
documentation and information translated into Japanese, so that it
is more easily accessible to developers in Japan.
</p>

<p>
After a lunch break a new, at least to me, FreeBSD Vendor, CacheIQ
gave a presentation about their product and their use of FreeBSD.
CacheIQ builds an SSD based NFS caching system on top of FreeBSD
and are interested in following the project's development tree more
closely.  What followed was a discussion of the project's release
policies and best practices relating to developing a product with
FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
From CacheIQ we moved on to testing and ATF.  Garrett Cooper presented
the work he's been doing, in collaboration with Simon Gerraty and
Marcel Moolenaar, to get ATF integrated into FreeBSD.  ATF was
originally written for NetBSD and has been in use there for a couple
of years now.  The goal is to have a good framework for automated
testing in FreeBSD and to improve the quality of our testing.  As
anyone who has worked with test frameworks knows, there are many
bike sheds to be avoided here, and Garrett, Simon and Marcel have
worked quite hard to keep away from picking colors, and have instead
gotten the system into shape and working on FreeBSD.  [As of the
writing of this newsletter ATF is now in HEAD under contrib/atf.]
</p>

<p>
Our last session of the day was creating a new have/need list for
vendors with the twist this time that we added a "co sponsor" list.
The FreeBSD Foundation is going to put up funds to co-sponsor
development projects with companies working on FreeBSD.  This has
already been successfully done in the past with projects such as
the NAND Flash project (co-sponsored with Juniper Networks) and
others.  The Foundation can't sponsor all these projects, but where
there is an ability to get cooperation on funding the development
it makes sense to get a few interested parties together to get the
work done.  The list of possible co-development projects includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>NetConf Agent</li>
<li>EFI Boot on amd64</li>
<li>NDMP</li>
<li>MIPS Super Pages</li>
<li>SID Base Credentials and ACLs</li>
<li>Xen Dom 0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Upcoming summits are in March at AsiaBSDCon and May at BSDCan.  Mark
your calendars.

<h2><a name="Grants">2012 Grant and Travel Grant Recipients</a></h2>
<p>
Every year we sponsor FreeBSD related conferences and travel to
these events for FreeBSD contributors.  We believe that BSD-centered
and FreeBSD-specific conferences play the dual roles of expanding
the FreeBSD user community and supporting collaborative development.
The FreeBSD Foundation's travel grant program helps to reduce
financial roadblocks to participation in these events.
</p>

</p>
Our grant recipients often send us amazing tales of their experiences,
proving the value of this program to the FreeBSD community.  You can find

Who are these people that receive money from the Foundation? How
are your donations making a difference in the FreeBSD community?
We've asked our grant recipients to share their stories with you
in what we call the "Faces of FreeBSD" campaign.  Tune in weekly
to the
<a href="http://freebsdfoundation.blogspot.com">FreeBSD Foundations's blog</a>
to hear how Foundation funding is used to run conferences, work on
development projects, help with travel expenses to conferences, and
to advocate for FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Looking for a recap of past stories?  Here are our first two "Faces of FreeBSD":

<p>
More than 30 million Netflix streaming members around the globe
watch more than a billion hours of movies and TV shows each month.
In the US, Netflix video streaming accounts for a third of peak
downstream Internet traffic. Netflix created Open Connect, a
single-purpose content delivery network, to help deliver these
petabytes of data.
</p>

<p>
The main component of Open Connect is the Open Connect Appliance,
a small-footprint network streaming device. The Open Connect Appliance
is a 4U Intel-based server that is designed to economically maximize
storage density in a space and power footprint that is ideal for
both ISP data centers and metro-area network interchanges.
</p>

<p>
The Open Connect Appliance runs on FreeBSD 9. Netflix picked FreeBSD
9 because it is a high performing, low-maintenance and reliable
operating system that is supported by major hardware vendors. FreeBSD
9 provides a foundation of reliability, performance, and hands-free
manageability. Combined with NGINX, a light-weight and high performance
Web server, FreeBSD 9 provides a simple but powerful solution that
is capable of serving tens of thousands of simultaneous video streams
across multiple 10Gbit fiber optic links.
</p>

<p>
Beyond its technical strengths, FreeBSD comes with an outstanding
ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users who openly share
expertise, talent, and technical improvements.  Netflix has embraced
this community and is committed to giving back its bug fixes and
enhancements, thus completing the circle of community collaboration.
