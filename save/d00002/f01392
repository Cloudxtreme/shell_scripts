We're feeling a bit black at the moment, due to the Australian Government's
attempts to ban essentially everything worthwhile about the Internet, i.e.: 
the bits that fall outside the bland conformity that the mass media would
have us believe is "normal".  This black banner is here as a form of protest -- 
Since the Australian Government has spent five years showing us that it'll
ignore the feelings of the populance on this issue, it's really the only
form of protest left available to me.  Click the image above to see
<a href="http://www.efa.org.au">EFA's</a> take on the issue, or read

The <tt>slash.dotat.org</tt> webserver is prototypical at the moment.  More
will be available here later.  Trust me.  Even though I've been saying that for
three years now, trust me.

I consider myself to be a free speech advocate, which is somewhat 
interesting in Australia.  Unlike our colleagues on the other side
of the pacific, Australia does not have a constitutional bill of
rights -- There is nothing in our constitution to guarantee freedom
of speech without interference from our governments.
<p></b>
<ul><i>
<p>
     Working under censorship is like being intimate with someone who
     does not love you, with whom you want no intimacy, but who presses
     himself in upon you. The censor is an intrusive reader, a reader
     who forces his way into the intimacy of the writing transaction,
     forces out the figure of the loved or courted reader, reads your
     words in a disapproving and censorious fashion.
     <p></i>
     -- J. M. Coetzee
     <p>
</ul>
<p><b>

However, the High Court has found that the constitutional right
to elect governments implies a right to freedom of political 
speech;  The Victorian Government apparently assumes that that 
right only exists until someone complains about it, though:  Witness
the <a href="http://dingo.vut.edu.au:80/~src/rab-censor/">Rabelais</a>
saga if you require evidence to back that statement up.  

<p>

Online freedom of speech is perhaps my greatest passion.  There is
a world-wide attack on the independence from interference which 
allowed the Internet to prosper in the first place.  Do-gooders all
over the planet believe that they have a better understanding of 
what should or shouldn't be read and written than you or I do.  As a civil libertarian,
I find these people highly obnoxious and unbelievably arrogant.
Their implicit message ("You're too stupid to decide what to read and
publish for yourself") should be offensive to everyone no matter 
what they believe about this issue.

<p></b>
<ul><i>[ The censors will tell me that they're more concerned about what
<b>other</b> people read and say.  In fact, they almost always talk
about the great unwashed masses of <b>other</b> people, even though
it's their own insecurities which they are attempting to censor.  These
people refuse to believe that their position can be taken personally,
even though (from my position) it comes down to a question of what 
they think <b>I</b> should or shouldn't be allowed to do. ]</i></ul><b>
