<H2><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="nwf_toc.html#SEC68">5.13 What are these 'silo overflows' when using the modem?</A></H2>

<P>
If you run high baud-rates on your modem, the computer might be to slow
to handle all those interrupts from the serial interface and drop some
characters, which it calls a 'silo overflow'. To prevent this, try one
of the following two solutions:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>Try setting bigger buffers for serial i/o. Put the following in

your kernel config file an recompile:


<PRE>
options	"SERIBUF_SIZE=4096"
options	"SEROBUF_SIZE=32"
</PRE>

<LI>If this doesn't work, you can try to play with the interrupt

system, lowering the clock-interrupts from level 6 to level 4, which
will no longer block the serial receive interrupts at level 5.
To do so, uncomment the following line from your kernel config file and
recompile:


<PRE>
options	LEV6_DEFER	# defers l6 to l4 (below serial l5)
</PRE>

</OL>
