<h1>The KAME IPR policy and concerns of some technologies which have IPR claims</h1>
written by <a href="http://www.kame.net/">the KAME project</a>
<hr />

<h2>Overview of our policy and concerns</h2>
<pre>
For the 1st/2nd/3rd phases (Apr 1998 - Mar 2004), the KAME
project had avoided implementing protocols which have
intellectual property rights(IPR) restrictions.

Our policy was that the KAME project implements only protocols which:
	- have no IPR restrictions
	- have IPR concerns, but are royalty-free
	- do not require any license for anyone AND are free of charge
          for usage

In other words, the KAME project does not implement protocols which:
	- require license for implementers or users, or
	- are not free of charge for usage

Here are reasons for this policy:

	- Software that the KAME project provides is free of charge.
          Thus, we cannot provide software which requires any payment.
	- The KAME project does not have a legal body to get such
          license when implementer is required to do so.
	- The KAME project cannot take care of users if they are
          required to get license.

There are some protocols which we once implemented but removed after
we noticed that they have IPR restrictions.

Two opinions were raised for our policy:
	- It is real waste to discard such implementations.
	- The KAME project should not be conservative if a patent is
          kinds of self defense.

Therefore, for the 4th phase (Apr 2004 - Mar 2006), we decided to try
negotiating with patent holders and finding a way to release our
implementations without IPR restrictions.

As of this writing, we notice that the following protocols have IPR 
restrictions.  We try to resolve IPR problems according to priority.

o Source Specific Multicast(SSM)
	Priority: high
	Implementation: done

o Modular Exponential(MODP)
	Priority: high
	Implementation: done

o Network Mobility(NEMO)
	Priority: high
	Implementation: not yet

o Internet Key Exchange version 2(IKEv2)
	Priority: high
	Implementation: ongoing

o Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol(ISATAP)
	Priority: high
	Implementation: done

o Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol(VRRP)
	Priority: medium
	Implementation: done

o SEcure Neighbor Discovery(SEND)
	Priority: low
	Implementation: not yet

o NAT Traversal(NAT-T)/UDP-ENCAP
	Priority: low
	Implementation: not yet

----

o TCP bug fixes (draft-ietf-tcpm-tcpsecure-00.txt)
	Priority: extremely high
	Implementation: done
	(probably this is *BSD problem, not KAME problem)

<h2>Detailed description of each technology</h2>
<pre>
(1) SSM

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/APPLE-SSM.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done

IPR claim overview:
  Once SSM becomes standard:

    "licenses will be available to any party on reasonable,
    nondiscriminatory terms, on condition of reciprocity and defensive
    use, for a compliant implementation of the protocol."

Concern:
  - Who should make a contract with Apple?  The IPR claim says, Apple
    will issue a license to "a compliant implementation of the
    protocol".  What does "a compliant implementation of the protocol"
    exactly mean?  Does it mean the code distributed from the KAME
    project?  Or does it mean all implementations which use KAME SSM
    code?  Or does it mean all users who are using KAME SSM code?

Request:
  - Making a contract is a barrier for the deployment of SSM.  We
    request an IPR claim which doesn't need any contract of a license.

Priority: high
  This is a big problem, since SSM is a promising candidate 
  for the deployment of IPv4/IPv6 multicasting.  Especially in IPv6,
  it is much easier to deploy SSM keeping pace with the deployment of
  IPv6.  If we failed this, we would end up deploying SSM after IPv6
  is widely deployed, and it will be tough to replace existing all
  IPv6 nodes with SSM capable nodes at that stage.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) MODP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/certicom-ipr-rfc3526-rfc2409-ikev2.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done

Concern:
  - It seems this IPR claim affects all applications which use MODP.
    IKE/IKEv2, which are standard key exchange protocols used in
    IPsec, are also affected, if this is the case.
  - What does "Certicom will provide a nonexclusive, royalty-free
    patent license, with reasonable terms and conditions" exactly
    mean?  Who should make a contract?

Request:
  - We request them to provide MODP group1 and group2, which are used
    in IKE/IKEv2, with no license.
  - A key exchange mechanism is necessary to deploy IPsec.  Posing
    contract of a license to use key exchange mechanisms will make a
    hurdle for IPsec deployment.

Priority: high
  This is a big problem, since there is no other replacement for
  IKE/IKEv2 for now.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) NEMO

URL:
  Cisco:
    http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/cisco-ipr-draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support.txt
  Nokia:
    http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/nokia-ipr-draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  - not implemented
    (c.f.)The Nautilus6 project has a NEMO implementation based on KAME
          (the code is not released)

IPR overview:
  Cisco:
    - NEMO users must make a contract with Cisco, if the patent
      submitted by Cisco related to NEMO covers NEMO technology we are
      going to use.  (The patent is not published yet, by the way)
    - The license is provided "under reasonable, non-discriminatory
      terms"
  Nokia:
    - NEMO implementors who are using technologies covered by the
      Nokia patents (US10/295014、WO03/043226) must use
      GPL(http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html) or an open source
      license (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html).

Concern:
  Cisco:
    - Assuming that KAME implements NEMO and the NEMO technology is
      covered by the Cisco patent, who should make a contract with
      Cisco?  Only the KAME project?  Or all KAME code integrators (such
      as BSD development teams)?  Or all users which use KAME-derived
      NEMO code
    - What does "under reasonable, non-discriminatory terms" exactly
      mean?
  Nokia:
    - The BSD license is listed as one of the compatible licenses with
      open source license.  However, it is unclear in the IPR claim
      that the BSD license is acceptable in this particular case.
    - Assuming that the BSD license is acceptable by Nokia, how about
      the KAME license?

Request:
  Cisco:
    - We request the IPR claim which doesn't require any contract of a
      license.
  Nokia:
    - We would like Nokia to accept the KAME license to distribute the
      NEMO technologies, if the technologies are covered by their
      patents.

Priority: high
  Deployment of network mobility is a key aspect of deployment of the
  whole mobility technologies.  We strongly want to distribute NEMO
  implementation to accelerate deployment of mobility.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) IKEv2

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/microsoft-ipr-draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  ongoing

Concern:
  - Microsoft says they have patents with regard to IKEv2.  However, it
    is unclear which part of the specification is covered by their
    patents.
  - Posing contract of a license ("Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory
    License to All Implementers with Possible Royalty/Fee") will make
    a hurdle for deployment of IKEv2.

Request:
  - We at least need clarification which part is affected by their
    patents.

Priority: high
Importance: urgent
  We don't have alternative key exchange mechanism other than IKE/IKEv2.
  It is very important for us to deploy IKE/IKEv2.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) ISATAP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/sri-ipr-draft-ietf-ngtrans-isatap.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done.  However, the code has been removed.

Concern:
  - What does "Royalty-Free, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory License
    to All Implementers" exactly mean?
    * Who should make a contract?  Only KAME?  Or implementors who use
      KAME derived code (e.g. FreeBSD)?
    * The licensing terms requested by SRI is unknown.  We cannot
      check if the license is compatible with ours.
  - We sent the above question to Peter Marcotullio (the contact person
    of this IPR), but got no reply.
  - Fred Templin(the author of the patent and ISATAP specification)
    said, he could do nothing because he did not work for SRI any longer.

Priority: medium
  ISATAP is often used as a transition mechanism especially in
  enterprise networks.  The KAME project has frequently received
  questions regarding why we removed the technology.  We want to
  provide ISATAP as one of transition mechanisms.

Note: This holds true for Teredo, too.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) VRRP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/NAT-VRRP-IBM
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/VRRP-CISCO
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/cisco-ipr-draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done.  However, the code has been removed due to the IPR issue.

Concern:
  The validity of the IPR claim:
    The patent which is referred by this IPR claim is for HSRP, not
    for VRRP.  Can it also apply to VRRP?  One expert
    (mcbride@openbsd.org) mentioned that VRRP was not affected by
    the HSRP patents.

Request:
  - Posing contract of a license will be a hurdle for deployment of
    VRRP.  We need a royalty free license which doesn't require any
    contract.

Priority: medium
  We don't have any urgent needs to distribute VRRP for IPv6 for now.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) SEND IPR:

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/ericsson-send-ipsec.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/microsoft-ipr-draft-ietf-send-cga.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/microsoft-ipr-draft-ietf-send-ipsec.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  not yet
  (note: we have received a request to implement SEND)

IPR claim overview:
  SEND will probably based on the CGA technology.
  - Ericsson says, everyone can use their patent as long as they do not
    attack Ericsson by their patent.
  - Microsoft says, implementers must get a license from Microsoft.

Concern:
  (Ericsson) KAME will not provide any code which has restrictive
    conditions to distribute.  In this case, "as long as the user
    doesn't attack Ericsson..." doesn't match the KAME IPR policy.
  (Common) It is unclear who should make a contract.  That is, who is
    "a compliant implementation of the protocol"?  Is it OK if the KAME
    project makes a contract?  Or do they need all KAME derived code
    (e.g. *BSD) to make contracts with them?  Or should all *BSD users
    make contracts with them?
  Posing contract of a license will be a hurdle for deployment of
  SEND.  We need a royalty free license which doesn't require any
  contract.

Priority: low
  We are not particularly interested in SEND, and we are not sure if
  it is ever deployed widely.  Right now, we are just watching IETF
  discussions of SEND.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(8) NAT-T/UDP-ENCAP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/MICROSOFT-NAT-Traversal.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/CISCO-mobileip-nat-traversal.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/MICROSOFT-NAT-Traversal.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/SSH-HUTTUNEN-IPSEC-ESP-IN-UDP
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/SSH-NAT

Implementation status in KAME:
  not yet

Concern:
  We need the NAT-T and UDP-ENCAP technologies to use IPsec over NAT.
  These technologies are now de-facto standard.  However, three
  companies (Microsoft, Cisco, SSH) claim they have patents for these
  technologies.  With which company/companies should we make a
  contract?

Priority: low
  Not all users use these technologies.  There is no urgency.
