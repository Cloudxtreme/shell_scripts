<h1>Phase 2: Health Sector and VIC6</h1>


</div>

<hr style="text-align:center;" /> <br/>

The aim of VIC6 Phase 2 was to build one or more demonstrations of IPv6
capability to support applications for the health sector. Arising from these
demonstrations, sector organisations would then be in a good position to gain
understanding and experience to allow smooth transition to IPv6, which will
ultimately stimulate health sector innovation based upon IPv6.


<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 
<br/>

<h4>Development of Phase 2</h4>

1. Business Analysis: discussions with the Victorian health sector on the
business parameters, issues and timelines to IPv6 adoption.
<br />

2. IPv6 Demonstration: based upon the Business Analysis, designing and
carrying out relevant demonstrations of health sector applications and
VIC6 network interoperability up the designed network, organising testing
and carrying out demonstrations.

<br />

4. Project Review: Based upon the above, providing a written analysis on the
results, the issues arising, and the potential benefits of IPv6 to the health sector. 

<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 
<br/>


<h4>
Phase 2 Participants
</h4>

After the outreach activities of VIC6 Phase 1, Ai Group and IPv6Now were
fortunate in attracting the interest of some of the most experienced and
innovative organisation within the Victorian health sector for Phase 2. 

Key health sector participants include the <a
href="http://ahml.ballarat.edu.au">Australian Healthcare Messaging Laboratory
(AHML)</a>, the <a href="http://www.healthinnovation.com.au">Centre for Health
Innovation (CHI)</a>, the <a href="http://cera.unimelb.edu.au">Centre for Eye Research
Australia (CERA)</a>, <a href="http://eyescan.com.au">Eyescan Pty Ltd</a>, the <a
href="http://www.grhanet.com.au">Grampian Rural Health Alliance Network (GRAHNet)</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.msia.com.au">Medical Software Industry Association of
Australia (MSIA)</a>.

<br /><br />

<br/>

<h4>VIC6 Health Sector Workshop 1</h4>

The first VIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting was held on Wednesday 1
April 2009 at the Ai Group offices. Discussion continued over the following
weeks in person and by email.  The participants described their areas of
interest in potential IPv6 demonstrations, which fell into four groups: Network
architecture and operations, Standards and interoperability, Clinical services,
and Innovative capability.

<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 
<br/>

<h4>VIC6 Health Sector Workshop 2</h4>

The second VIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting was held at the Centre for
Health Innovation, Melbourne, and Greenhill Enterprise Centre, University
Drive, Mount Helen, Ballarat, on 30 April 2009, with vidoconferencing between
the locations.  Discussion from the first workshop had suggested a number of
potential demonstrations, and the focus of this workshop was to narrow down the
possibilities to something achievable within the time and infrastructure
constraints.

<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 
<br/>

<h4>VIC6 Health Sector Workshop 3</h4>

The third VIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting was held at the Centre for
Health Innovation, Melbourne, 29 May 2009, with videoconferencing to the
Ballarat participants. Detailed discussion of the proposed demonstrations took
place.  Here is a concept diagram for the demonstrations:

<br/>

<h4>VIC6 Health Sector Workshop 4</h4>

The fourth VIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting was held at the Ai Group
offices, Melbourne, 22 June 2009, with teleconferencing and videoconferencing
to other participants. Further planning and detailed discussion of technical
aspects of the demonstration took place.


<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 
<br/>

<h4>VIC6 Health Sector Workshop 5</h4>

The fifth VIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting was held on 28 July 2009,
via videoconferencing between the Centre for Health Innovation, the Centre for
Eye Research Australia, and the Greenhill Enterprise Centre, Ballarat.
Although there are still some further technical enhancements to come, we saw a
significant step forward using IPv6 in the VIC6 Health Sector Demonstration.

<br /><br />

VIC6 would particularly like to express appreciation for the resources
contributed by <a href="http://eyescan.com.au/">Eyescan</a> to the VIC6
project, demonstrating how new Internet technologies can build value for the
health sector.  We succeeded in working with Eyescan to show an improved
model of remote access to ophthalmic imaging equipment, against some
substantial challenges.

<br /><br />

During the VIC6 Health Sector Demonstration, we showed in real time how we
could achieve direct remote access to eye scanning and manipulation software.
This remote access was achieved direct to the specific device by way of the new
Internet Protocol, IPv6.  We used this approach to demonstrate live access to,
and remote operation of, the actual Eyescan computer during the VIC6 Health
Working group meeting.

<br /><br />

As a marked difference from previous approaches, access to the machine was
facilitated by using a domain name, eyescan1.tunnels.ipv6now.com.au, rather
than the current arrangement that relies on an IP address and port (eg
203.123.456.789:9999).  Our approach required no additional intervention from
network administrators once the computer itself is configured, and did not
depend on configuration of other parts of the Eyescan network. The technique
was supported by IPv6 tunnels and network infrastructure provided by 
<a href="http://www.ipv6now.com.au">IPv6Now Pty Ltd</a>.

<br /><br />

For the health sector, there is an important lesson in this demonstration. Our
understanding is that access to eye scanning equipment is severely constrained
by two factors:
<br /><br />

<ul>

<li> image viewing and manipulation software for ophthalmic applications is not
freely available due to licensing constraints, and

<li> much ophthalmic software is designed only to operate on Windows XP(tm)
operating system, which is now superseded. (It turns out that XP is not
friendly to IPv6 either.)

</ul>

<br />
Eyescan pioneered the concept of remote access to the results of ophthalmic
scanning by allowing 'remote desktop access'.  Under the VIC6 Health
Demonstration project, we were able to move the Eyescan 'remote desktop'
approach to the new Internet Protocol, IPv6, allowing demonstration that remote
access to ophthalmic scanning results could be easily arranged between multiple
remote locations.

<br /><br />

In practical terms, this means that the subjects of ophthalmic scanning
(patients) and the expertise in analysis of ophthalmic scanning (clinicians) do
not have to be co-located, at least for initial analysis.  Subsequently, if
this approach was made widely available, significant savings could be made in
avoiding unneeded travel, by patients and/or clinicians, and much improved
services could be provided to regional and remote locations.

<br /><br />

There is now the prospect of more thorough research into the efficiency and
clinical effectiveness of remote access to ophthalmic scanning results.
Jonathan Crowston of CERA has suggested that there could be the possibility of
some pilot studies in this area, perhaps in collaboration with the RVEEH and
the Grampian Regional Health Alliance, potentially leading to more substantial
research projects.

<br /><br />

<h4>Further VIC6 Health Sector Workshops</h4>

TheVIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting on 18 August 2009 continued work
on IPv6 usage. The AHML discussed its HL7 messaging protocol system, which
was implemented because 'IPv4 can't be trusted'. There appeared to be great
potential added value to apply HL7 with a matrix of identification using
features of IPv6, particularly improved efficiency.

<br /><br />

TheVIC6 Health Sector Working Group meeting on 29 September 2009 provided a
further step in IPv6 video conferencing. Tandberg systems located at Centre
for Eye Research in Melbourne and the Grampians Rural Health Alliance
Network in Ballarat were connected via an IPv6Now IPv6 tunnel into VIC6, to
provide the simplest connection we have seen so far, but still maintaining a
high level of quality to support effective videoconferencing.  
<br /><br />

<h2>Summary: VIC6 and the Health Sector</h2>
Phase 2, the VIC6 Health Sector and IPv6, has successfully demonstrated key
operation of general purpose network implementations that support data,
voice and video using IPv6 for various health applications.  

<br /><br />

Several video conference demonstrations over IPv6 have been successfully
completed between Grampians Rural Health Alliance Network, Ballarat and the
Centre for Eye Research in Melbourne.  Simpler remote access over IPv6 has
been demonstrated with Eyescan, a new eye health service delivery business.
The Centre for Health Innovation has been established as the first VIC6
Industry Node after enabling IPv6 on its network, as a future foundation for
innovate health solutions.

<br /><br />

There is also the future prospect of more thorough research into the
efficiency and clinical effectiveness of remote access to ophthalmic
scanning results via IPv6. CERA has suggested pilot studies in this area,
perhaps in collaboration with the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital
(RVEEH) and GRAHNet, potentially leading to more substantial research
projects.

<br /><br />

Further work is planned between IPv6Now and the Australian Health Messaging
Laboratory to demonstrate operation of the HL7 health messaging standard
using IPv6 over VIC6.
