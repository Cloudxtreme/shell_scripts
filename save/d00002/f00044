      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. ICANN has designed a fair, equitable,
        and open process for evaluating applications for new TLDs. ICANN
        Board members have recently received a stream of e-mail comments
        concerning applications. While they are committed to being accessible
        to the public regarding ICANN matters, they have asked us to
        remind applicants, their supporters, their detractors, and all
        others that <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-app-review-procedure-02oct00.htm#5">beginning
        13 October there will be a public comment forum</A> allowing
        interested parties to comment, with their comments open for review
        by everyone. ICANN Board members/staff will review these comments.
        Private comments sent directly to Board members and the staff
        are neither appropriate nor helpful in this process because they
        do not support ICANN's commitment to openness and transparency.</FONT></P>

        <A HREF="http://www.icann.org/biog/abriliabril.htm">Amadeu Abril
        i Abril</A>, has a prior affiliation with an ICANN-accredited
        registrar that has been working on new TLD applications. Mr.
        Abril i Abril has issued the following note:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To the Board and Conflicts Committee:</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">This note is to inform that I will not
          be participating in any ICANN Board votes or discussions relating
          to the current application process for new TLDs.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">While I am not directly involved with any
          new TLD applications, I recuse myself on the basis of my (loose)
          affiliation with an ICANN-accredited registrar (Nominalia) that
          has been working on new TLD applications, as well as the public
          percepcion created by my frequent appearences as speaker or supporter
          of another ICANN-accredited registrar (CORE) involved in a number
          of applications, too.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a Director, I do plan to continue stating
          my views on general policy matters relating to new TLDs (as opposed
          to concrete application evaluation). In the interest of full
          transparency, I will copy any such emails to the DNSO Names Council
          as their list is publicly posted and archived.</FONT></P>
