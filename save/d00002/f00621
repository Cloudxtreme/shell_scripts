on contracts to extend GnuPG.  This contract work allowed me to
continue my regular work on GnuPG on my own time.  This is a kind of
collateral benefit.  If the ordered extensions are mainly interesting
for the client, there is no big problem.  The costumer gets what he
wants, the public may use the new features if they are useful to them,
and I can make a living.
</p><p>
A problem occurs if extensions are ordered which are directly useful
for the public or even have been suggested for a long time.  In this
case I often had to delay work on such features, either to wait for a
customer or to settle the development contract.  That is because most
clients don’t like to pay for stuff which has already been
implemented.  If the negotiations take long (sometimes more than a
year), it is annoying for the public that they have to wait for new
features for a long time — despite that it is sometimes only a few
days of work.  The problem is that a particular feature is part of a
longer list of features a client has asked for.  Striking out work
item after work item during the negotiations, because they have have
been implemented in the meantime, might be good for the client but not
for me.  They may even make the client believe that he only needs to
talk a few more weeks to cut down the price even more.
</p><p>
Thus my conclusion is that development contracts done in the standard
IT business manner don’t work well in the free software world.  They
don’t foster development but destroy the very benefit we have with our
“community” driven style of development: creativity and the avoidance
of features introduced to justify a higher price.
</p><p>
So, how can professional free software development be done without
falling into this pit?  I have no clear answer to it.  As a
prerequisite clients need to understand that they benefit by all means
of development; whether done by a contractor or independently by
someone else.  Ideally they should donate to a global project fond to
support general development.  Individual contractors may still be
hired for quality assurance tasks and to oversee the development of
features required by the client.  It will be hard to work against
fixed deadlines; but how often have such deadlines been kept anyway?
