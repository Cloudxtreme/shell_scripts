<h1>Phase 3: Financial Sector and VIC6</h1>


</div>

<hr style="text-align:center;" /> <br/>

The aim of VIC6 Phase 3 was to build one or more demonstrations of IPv6
capability to support applications for the financial services sector. Arising
from these demonstrations, sector organisations would then be in a good
position to gain understanding and experience to allow smooth transition to
IPv6, which will ultimately stimulate sector innovation based upon IPv6.


<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 
<br/>

<h4>Development of Phase 3</h4>

1. Business Analysis: discussions with the Victorian financial
sector on the business parameters, issues and timelines to IPv6 adoption.
<br />

2. IPv6 Demonstration: based upon the Business Analysis,
designing relevant demonstrations of financial sector applications and VIC6
network interoperability.
<br />

3. Project Review: Based upon the above, providing a written analysis on
the results, the issues arising, and the potential benefits of IPv6 to
the financial sector. 

<br /><br />
<hr style="text-align:center;" /> 

<h2>Financial Sector Input</h2>
Material for the business analysis of the needs of the financial services
sector was obtained by VIC6, despite the sector's considerable distraction
regarding the Global Financial Crisis, which imposed a significant delay on
both outreach and activities. Despite the difficulties, VIC6 Financial
Services Working Group meetings took place on 13 July 2009 and 12 August
2009. A VIC6 Financial Services Workshop was held on 9 September 2009 in
Ballarat, to clarify useful areas for an IPv6 demonstration.

<br /><br />

All participants were focused on survival and cost in the context of the
financial crisis, but were still extremely helpful in clarifying potential
finance sector involvement in IPv6 and the VIC6 TestNet. Over time,
participants included eVision Pty Ltd, the Internet Commerce Security
Laboratoryi (ICSL), from the Centre for Informatics and Applied Optimisation
(CIAO) University of Ballarat, eB2Bcom, and Financial Services Protection
Limited.

<br /><br />

<h4>1. Business Analysis</h4>
Areas of interest covered production readiness testing, tips &amp; pitfalls,
transition cost estimating, issues with legacy backend systems, mobile
internet access devices, system-to-system messaging solutions, the potential
for a message exchange facility on VIC6, authentication issues, IPv6
readiness, and security and potential IPv6 malware. Discussions with sector
members covered the following areas.

<br /><br />

<h5>eVision</h5> 
Interested in loading MessageXchange platform for B2B transactions into VIC6
plus provision of training and outline of platform operation. Opportunity
for others to develop new transaction models. Further development to occur
under the VIC6 T&amp;C's, that is, non-production system 
but trialling for production.

<br /><br />

<h5>eB2Bcom</h5> 
They're interested in moving their facilities using an Active Directory
service to IPv6. How will their software work in v6? eB2B have customers in
defence but also perform authentication so impacts customers in finance
industry.

<br /><br />

<h5>ICSL</h5> 
Two student projects have started, plus there is the capacity for more
student projects. A relationship has developed with Chinese expertise and
ICSL whereby IPv6 transactions can undergo rigorous testing for financial
systems when subjected to a level of threat. In particular, will existing
systems work? 

<br /><br />

ICSL input regarding threats from malevolent users:
Element missing from testing: legitimate public users are not the only users
of the Internet, illegitimate users are also present. Need to be able to
emulate illegal activity as part of the testbed. 
Potential student activity from the ICSL to generate illegal activity
emulation.
Aust Govn assistance also available especially law enforcement agencies,
however they may not be interested in shared activity with other countries. 

<br /><br />

AFP visiting ICSL in Ballarat in October (Tentative date 20/10)
to discuss combined research with ICSL. There may be interest in the
benefits that IPv6 may have for AFP or any law enforcement agency,
especially with regard to: 
<ul>
<li>Tracebacks </li>
<li>Filtering </li>
<li>Denial of service - is there an opportunity to test IPv6 best practices?
</li>
<li>What are the areas of interest from both the attacker's and victim's
standpoint? </li>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
 1. Malware and botnets <br />
 2. Distributed Denial of Service attacks<br />
</div>
<li>Role of NAT in protection</li>
<li>Attacks occurring primarily at the perimeter</li>
</ul>

<br />

IBM is able to contribute some intellectual property regarding best practice
in  IPv4, need to then develop best practice for v6 and compare the two via
the  VIC6 testbed. Individuals within IBM involved with network security
have expressed interest. This activity needs to focus on real needs of the
marketplace required to roll out IPv6. AGIMO has brought forward the
timetable for IPv6 deployment within government with which DSD will need to
comply.

<br /><br />

ICSL has Professor Lu visiting from Chin Hua University early in 2010 who
may be able to use VIC6. A masters student is working on IP Traceback who
may be able to work with existing two students working with VIC6.

<br /><br />

<h5>ICSL Student Projects</h5>
Project 1 (Nico):
<br />Attempting simulation using IPSec as security at the network layer and
will then test performance comparing the relative performance between IPSec under IPv6
and IPv4.  
<br />Challenge at the moment is to achieve a workable setup capable of being
measured. Overall project needs to be finished by Oct 30. 
<br />The report will examine the relative efficiencies achieved because of
the fact that v6 was designed from the outset to work with IPSec whereas v4 has had it
fitted on as an afterthought. 
<br />The report will be publicly available and specifically will be
available to the VIC6 project. 

<br /><br />

Project 2 (RR): Trying to implement IPv4 banking system in IPv6.

<br /><br />

Future student projects: No technical training of IPv6 and even not enough
technical training on IPv4 in the curriculum. Mobile phone and laptop are a
natural fit with IPv6. The financial services edge device will be the mobile
devices, this is especially true for the emerging economies in particular
China. ICSL should be investigating and studying mobile clients:
VIC6 is a fixed network at the moment. 
Can a telco (Telstra, Optus etc) be approached? 
Can the 6in4 tunnel client be compiled for a mobile phone OS? Could this be
a future student project? 

<br /><br />

<h5>Financial Services Protection Ltd</h5>
Approaches to non-technical financial service representatives to be involved
with VIC6. An approach has been made to Mr John Rappell from Financial
Services Protection Ltd. Suggested approaching Securities Industry Research
Centre for Asia Pacific (SIRCA), National Securities Exchange, Ex GM of
Comsec. Email to be sent under Ai Letterhead after approval and vetting from
John Rappell. 

<br /><br />

<h4>2. Financial Sector IPv6 Demonstrations</h4>
On the basis of industry discussions, potential areas suggested for
exploration included: production readiness testing, tips & pitfalls,
transition cost estimating, issues with legacy backend systems, mobile
internet access devices, system-to-system messaging solutions, the potential
for a message exchange facility on VIC6, authentication issues, IPv6
readiness, and security and potential IPv6 malware. In particular:

<br /><br />

<b>ICSL:</b> two Honours graduates were utilising the VIC6 testbed as part of Phase 3
(supervised by the University of Ballarat and the Internet Commerce Security
Lab):
Their work focusses on the implications of utilising IPSEC in relation to
consumer-based online banking and a comparative analysis of IPSEC in IPv4
and IPv6. 
The demonstration will involve setting up connections between virtual
machines set up by VIC6 and a consumer-type laptop from outside the network.

<br /><br />

<b>FSPL:</b> a meeting took place on 30 July between IPv6Now VIC6 representative Kevin
Karp and Mr John Rappell from Financial Services Protection Ltd, to identify
key finance industry contacts that are technology innovators.  The intention
is to make contact with identified individuals, with a view to involving
them in VIC6 test activities. Organisations identified with initial
contacts: Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific (SIRCA),
National Securities Exchange (NSX), Commonwealth Bank of Australia/Comsec.
The FSPL application was identified as technically a suitable candidate for
the Financial Services VM demonstration. 
<br />
<ul>
<li>September 2009: Meetings with FSPL commenced with a view to obtaining
approval from the FSP Board for this activity to proceed. 
</li><li>February 2010: Board considered invitation to be the demonstrated VM
application and formally granted its approval.
</li></ul>

<br />

<b>eVision Pty Ltd:</b> can provide their MessageXchange platform for use on VIC6
- they need to test its performance on IPv6 and dual stack, then they need
  to encourage their customers to implement systems using IPv6. Can make
available technical experise, licences and Virtual Servers. We have
discussed the technical requirements of implementing their platform in VIC6,
which looks like being an implementation of a virtual server.

<br /><br />

<b>eB2Bcom:</b> want to test their active directory system under IPv6 re their
defence customers.  The system has links to authentication and could be
brought under the ambit of Financial Services. This demonstration did not
proceed.

<br /><br />

<h5>Demonstration Implementations</h5> August 2009: Initial discussions with
eVision to import a Virtual Machine (VM) into the VIC6 Virtual Server
facility, including discussion of preparation of VIC6 facility. Work was
ongoing with PPS and Lateral Plains regarding importing VMWare VMs. Ballarat
VIC6 node was moved from Xen to Proxmox/KVM virtualisation technology. 

<br /><br />

March-August 2010: Technical Preparation of the FSPL VM commences for
installation into the VIC6 Virtual Server facility. Repeated attempts at
incorporation of FSPL VM into VIC6 facility and testing to confirm
operation. 17 August 2010: The FSPL VM succesfully runs and operates in the
VIC Virtual Server facility.


<br /><br />

<h2>Review</h2>
Although the FSPL Virtual Machine installation was successful, the Financial
Services Sector in general was not able to proceed with any major
utilisation of VIC6 due to the project running over time into late 2010.
However it was clear from a number of the issues raised by those involved in
financial sector security that testing IPv6 will become fundamentally
important as the sector transitions out of IPv4 into IPv6.

<br /><br />

There was considerable interest in continuing activities of the Working
Groups past the immediate life of the project. In particular IBM (via the
ICSL) expressed an interest in contributing some of its intellectual
property embodied in IPv4 best practices and then modifying them to suit
IPv6 and finally comparing the relative merits of the two.
There was also considerable interest in formulating new student projects
particularly around the areas of curriculum work in the development of IPv6
training and mobile device use of IPv6.
