<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
INN (InterNetNews) is a very full-featured and flexible news server
package, originally written by Rich Salz in 1991 as a higher performance
alternative to C News.  It was then maintained for some time by Dave Barr,
then by James Brister, and then by Katsuhiro Kondou and I.  I've since had
to cut back significantly on the work I do on INN due to lack of time, but
other people (particularly Julien &Eacute;LIE) have picked up the
slack I left.
</p>

<p>
The main copyright for INN is held by <a href="https://www.isc.org/">Internet Systems
Consortium, Inc.</a>, which gratiously hosts the mailing lists and FTP
distribution site for INN.  This is not the <a href="https://www.isc.org/software/inn/">official
home page for INN</a>, but instead is a collection of my personal notes on
INN and HTML conversions of INN's documentation.
</p>

<p>
INN doesn't try to be the fastest possible news server, or the simplest,
and it's definitely not the easiest to configure.  It does try to be one
of the most flexible, as well as acceptably fast for even large sites, and
over the years it's been used by many people as a platform for
experimentation with new news protocol ideas.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>
INN is written in ANSI C, so it requires a C compiler and a modern
operating system that supports ANSI C.  gcc will work fine.  It also
requires Perl, at least version 5.004_03, since many supporting utilities
and parts of the build system are written in Perl.  To build INN, you also
need a reasonably decent make program that supports include; GNU make will
do quite well.
</p>

<p>
For support for authenticated control messages, you need either PGP
or GnuPG, the latter being recommended.  For embedded filtering and
authentication hook support, you need either Perl 5.005 or later
(5.8 or later recommended) or Python 1.5.2 or later (2.5 or later
recommended), depending on what language you want to write your filters
and authentication hooks in.
</p>

<p>
For the ovdb overview storage method, you'll need Berkeley DB 4.4 or later
(4.7 or later recommended).  If you have zlib available, you can also
compress overview before it's stored into ovdb.  For support for news
reading over SSL, you'll need OpenSSL.  To support SASL authentication to
nnrpd or to feed newsgroups to an IMAP server with SASL authentication,
you'll need the Cyrus SASL libraries.  INN can also check passwords
against a Kerberos v5 KDC; for this, you will need Kerberos libraries.
