<p><cite>"The NLnet Foundation is better at identifying and supporting promising computing projects than any other non-profit.  The NLnet Foundation was the first outside funding for Ksplice, and NLnet's early support helped Ksplice to perform important software development and later receive more than $1M in other awards, including recognition by the Wall Street Journal as the top security innovation of the year. The NLnet Foundation's unique model enables them to achieve greater impact with their funding than other non-profits."</cite></p>

today, if the NLnet Foundation wasn't there to support ambitious leaps
forward, such as its Application Boundaries Enforcer module or its porting

aid. NoScript is just one of the many public interest open source projects

<p><cite>Our world runs on information technologies that are poorly understood by
most policy makers and dominated by commercial interests. NLnet is a
vital institution that supports important research, development and
awareness projects in areas that have high value for society but that
may not (yet) be commercially viable. IT is too important to be left
just to the technology vendors. When government fails it is great to see
private, non-profit institutions like NLnet taking up the slack and
making sure projects that are critical to society are realised.</cite></p>

core team, make an initial software release and make the progress that
enabled us to go on to get longer-term funding, so that we can achieve
our vision of giving the gift of free mobile communications to those
who currently lack it.  The light-weight application process and fast
turn-around were critical in ensuring that we could focus on what we
were doing.  The foundation also provided us with great feedback that

<p><cite>The "bootstrap" effect of the NLnet grants can be enormous. NLnet really has a nose for developments that will become very important in the future, and helps to get them to happen.</cite></p><p><cite>From its early days NLnet foundation has set itself the task to let new developments take off in area of internet and information technology, and open source.</cite><cite>

With a limited starter subsidy researchers can develop their ideas through prototypes and publications to the point where other financial resources become available to further build out the R&D.

Our project (Adaptive Hypermedia for All) is an excellent example: it started with an NLnet grant developing a general purpose adaptive hypermedia platform (AHA!, Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture). With this project our research group at Eindhoven University of Technology catapulted a new line in research in adaptive systems that has led to projects with the Netherlands science foundation (NWO), ITEA projects and even a European Seventh Framework project with 15 partners and a budget of over five million euro. </cite></p>

<p><cite>NLNet recently provided us with funds to work on creating an open source project aimed at providing a common control system for DNS servers. This grant has allowed a small business to step back from billable work for a while and given us a great opportunity to work on something that we strongly believe will help the wider Internet community.</cite></p>
<p><cite> In addition we have used much of the software that has resulted from NLNet's long-term funding of NLNet Labs. This work has been vital in ensuring that there are diverse code bases of standards complient software available, which in turn has greatly improved the security and reliability of the Internet's infrastructure.</cite></p>

<p><cite>"Funding innovation is a very tricky business. Structures either become too heavy to be manageable for innovators, or the organizations fund well-sold nonsense because the decision is made by people without sufficient understanding of the state of the art. NLnet has an outstanding track record over many years of combining high levels of competency and understanding for strategically important technologies with administrative processes that don't get in the way of the innovation. This combination with its focus on technologies that provide software freedom make NLnet unique, and clearly one of a handful of organization that I can wholeheartedly recommend for support."</cite></p>

improve the internet and the way we communicate on it. They fund
development of software, protocols and standards that improve the way we

do this by supporting the technological groundwork.  </p></cite>

essential to their success.  </p></cite>

A grant from Stichting NLnet made it possible for me to free up time and finally implement the first few versions of what became the Binary Analysis Tool.

After the first version that confirmed that it was indeed possible to
automate a lot of work efficiently the project took off. There is a
solid tool that has attracted interest in the field and consequent
donations to the project from third parties, it has spawned academic
research and it for sure has made my work a lot easier."</cite></p>

In helping open source developers realize their technology dreams through seed funding, NLNet has for many years provided the last crucial ingredient for many of their projects. The often small contribution by NLNet helps technology entrepreneurs follow through with projects that they already spent countless hours preparing.

would have struggled to obtain purely voluntary or commercial investment, yet 
which delivered long term benefit in reducing risk and uncertainty around Free 
Software supply chain management. Perhaps most admirable is NLnet's commitment 
to sustainable investment, and their requirement that each project that receives 
support plans for a self-funding, lasting future. This is an exceptional 
organization, and one that has contributed a great deal towards ensuring that 
open, empowering and widely available solutions are provided to the emerging
