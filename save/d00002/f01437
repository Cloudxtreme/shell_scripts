<P>This paper evaluate the robustness of multicast routing and the performance
evaluation of multicast service using the experimental network.&nbsp; For
the performance evaluation of multucast service, we use the the DV (Digital
Video)&nbsp; transmission service, as the practical application for the
next generation Internet.&nbsp; The evaluatoin system uses the PIM (Protocol
Independent Multicast), that is an RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) multicast
routing protocol.&nbsp; The packet loss observed at the end host is evaluated,
compared with the
<BR>case where the system provide the multicast service using N of the
multiple unicast packet transmission.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can make sure the
multicast system has better system scalability, regarding the number of
receivers, than the unicast based multicast system has.&nbsp; PIM operates
correctly and stably, even when the network has a routing loop. Finally,
we operate the DV multicast service over the nation-wide JB project IPv6
network using the PIM-SM, to make sure the correct operation.

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Introduction</FONT></U></B>

<P>The most of the data communications over the currently operating Internet
is using the unicast data transmission with TCP or
<BR>UDP.&nbsp; And, many exisiting applications do transfer exactly the
same data to large number of receivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the upcomming
Internet applications will includes a realtime multicast services, such
as DV (Digital Video) program multicasting service or interactive multi-party
multimedia conferences or games.&nbsp; We have to establish a stable and
cost effective multicast data transmission infrastructure for the next
generation Internet applications.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a multicast data transmission, when a sender
transfers a single packet toward the particular multicast group, the network
copies the packet to transfer them only to the particularreceivers belonging
to the corresponding multicast group.&nbsp; Since the sender does not need
to send the same data to every receivers, the network can provide an efficient
multicast data transmission services.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the multicast data
transmission, the required processing power at the sender and the required
bandwidth for the sender can be smaller than those with the unicast data
transmission.&nbsp; Since the total number of packtes transferred by the
network with multicast data transmission is smaller than that with unicast
data transmission, the possibility of inappropriate routing protocol operation
due to the large amount of user packet transmission with multicast data
transmission would be less than that with unicast data transmission. Also,
the diversity of the data reception time by the receivers must be smaller
that with the unicast data transmission, and the data reception delay by
the revievers must be smaller than that with the unicast transmission.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the multicast service may have
the following technical concernings.
<UL>
<LI>
&nbsp;the performance of packet transmission at the router may degrade,
due to the copying of multicast packets.&nbsp; This is because the copying
the received packet at the router is a new function for the router.</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;the network congestion due to the routing loop with multicast packet
will be worse than that with unicast packet.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because
the number of links and nodes affected by the routing loop with multicast
packet transmission should be larger than that with unicast packet transmission.</LI>
</UL>
The evaluated system in this paper has the following features;
<UL>
<LI>
Digital Video (DV) multicasting</LI>

<BR>DV is one of the popular applications with high speed data transmission
used in the next generation Internet.&nbsp; Also, the DV is an application,
that is sensitive to the&nbsp; packet loss and the delay jitter.
<LI>
PC based router and host</LI>

<BR>For flexible and cost effective network operation, the experimental
system uses the conventional PCs for routers and hosts.
<LI>
PIM-SM multicast routing protocol [8]</LI>

<BR>For effective and scalable multicast service, we used the PIM-SM (Protocol
Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode) routing protocol.
<LI>
Native IPv6 network [9]</LI>

<BR>Since the IPv6 technology is the fundamental core protocol for the
upcomming Internet, the experimental system operated over the IPv6 network.</UL>
We implemented the PC router, that can operate the PIM-SM with IPv6 and
the PC host, that can send and receive the DV data using the PIM-SM with
IPv6.&nbsp; Using these PC based routers and hosts, we developed both the
local area and the wide area experimantal networks.&nbsp; The wide area
exeprimental network accommodate the live traffic with the conventional
applications, as well as the
<BR>experimental DV multicast application. Also, the experimental network
was not a loop free topology.&nbsp; Therefore, the experimental network
would create a transitional routing loop with some network status.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the experimental network, we evaluate the
performence of packet transmission, compared with the performance where
the
<BR>multicast service is provided by the multiple unicast packet transmissions.&nbsp;
Also, we evaluate the stability of routing protocol operation with high
speed DV data transmission.&nbsp; It was shown that the experimental system
works well with the high speed DV data multicast application, even when
the system has a routing loop.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a further study item, it
is recognised that we should evaluate the effectiveness of the packet scheduling
mechanism to provide different quality of service among system control
information
<BR>(e.g., routing protocol information) and user information.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 2 evaluates the performance of packet transmission,
compared with the case where the multicast service is provided by the multiple
unicast transmissions.&nbsp; Section 3 evaluates the robustness and the
stability of the multicast routing protocol.&nbsp; Section 4 describes
the experimantal operation of DV stream multicast service over the nation-wide
JB project IPv6 network using IPM-SM.&nbsp; Finally, sectin 5gives a brief
conclusion.

<P>Figures 1 and 2 show the evaluation system.&nbsp; Sender (Snd1) sends
the packets to two receiver hosts (Rcv1 and Rcv2) through the routers (R1
and R2).&nbsp; Rcv1 and Rcv2 receive the same data from Snd1, i.e., multicating
from Snd1 to Rcv1 and Rcv2.&nbsp; R1 and R2 are connected through the OC-3
ATM link, and the hosts (Snd1, Rcv1 and Rcv2) are connected to the routers
through the 100MBase-T links.

<CENTER>Figure 2. Experimantal Configuration for Multicast by Multicast
Session</CENTER>


<P>In the configuration of figure 1, Snd1 estblish two (unicast) packet
flows to each receiver host.&nbsp; This is the case where the multicast
service is provided by the multiple unicast connections. Routers (R1and
R2) do not need to copy the received data, and the sender
<BR>host (Snd1) copies the sending data.&nbsp; In the configuration of
figure 2, Snd1 establish one (multicast) packet flow to the receiver hosts.&nbsp;
This is the case where the multicast service is provided by a single multicast
connection. The router R2 copies the received data to deliver the data
to receivers (Rcv1 and Rcv2). Here, with the configuration of figure 2,
PIM-SM is applied to as the multicast routing.&nbsp; Sender host (Snd1)
can control the packet transmission rate to the network, with the rate
control (i.e., shaping).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown, the router can not relay the unicast packets,
in accordance with the increase of packet transmission rate from the sender
with unicast based multicast.&nbsp; However, with the multiast service,
the router can relay the packets and the packet dropped rate does not increase
even when the packet transmissionrate from the sender host (Snd1) increases.

<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.1 Overview of RPF Multicast Routing</FONT></B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RPF represents Reverse Path Forwarding.&nbsp;
RPF is commonly used in the major multicast routing protocols, such as
PIM that is used in the evaluation system discussed in this paper.&nbsp;
In RPF system, the multiast packet transmission is executed using the unicast
routing information.&nbsp; The multicast session is recognized and managed
by the pair of sourece node IP address ("S") and IP multicast address assigned
for the multucast group ("G"), i.e., {S,G}.&nbsp; When the router receives
the multicast packet, the router checks the source IP address in it.

<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
multicast packet should relay based on the unicast routing information</FONT></UL>
&nbsp;Therefore, the RPF multicast routing does not need any additional
routing mechanism for a multicast service, i.e., it only needs the unicast
routing information.&nbsp; Also, when the IP multicast packet is received
from the wrong interface compared to the unicast routing information, the
received multicast packets are automatically and silently discarded.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This mechanism avoids the packet forwarding to the
routing loop.&nbsp; When the unicast routing system has the routing loop,
the packet transferred into the loop shall discarded due to the mismatch
of unicast routing information to the source IP address and the interface
receiving the IP multicast packet.&nbsp; This function of RPF multicast
routing has a significant benefit, compared with the unicast based multicast
service.&nbsp; With the unicast based multicast service, the packet has
to be looped in the network until the TTL expires. However, with the multicast
service using the RPF, it is expected that the packets are discared at
the entry router to the routing loop.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.2 Evaluation System</FONT></B>

<P>Figure 4 shows the evaluation system.&nbsp; Sender (Snd1) sends the
multicast packets toward two receiver hosts (Rcv1 and Rcv2) through the
routers (R1, R2 and R3).&nbsp; All routers run the PIM-SM multicast routing
protocol.&nbsp; All the data links in the system are 100MBase-T.

In the evaluation system, the R1 has the inappropriate unicast routing
information. For R1, the next hop router to transfer the packet toward
Snd1is the R3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the routing toward the Snd1 has the
routing loop among R1, R2 and R3.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.3 Evaluation Results</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The multicast packets are transferred to the
first hop router R1.&nbsp; R1 has to discard the all the received multicast
IP packet from the Snd1 node, since the interface receiving the IP multicast
packet is different from the interface RPF expected.&nbsp;&nbsp; We manually
modify the routing information at R1, so that the evaluation system has
a routing loop among R1, R2, and R3.&nbsp; By the applicatin of the RPF
mechanism, it is expected that the R1 silently drop the multicast packets.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experimental system actually discard the IP
multicast packets at the R1, when the R1 has the wrong unicast routing
information to form a routing loop.&nbsp; When we use the multiple unicast
connection to provide the multicast service from Snd1 to Recv1 and Rcv2,
the unicast packets do loop among the R1, R2 and R3.&nbsp; Moreover, the
packet to be looped shall be two packet flows (both toward Recv1 and toward
Rcv2).&nbsp; We did make sure the routing loop has generate the congestion
with unicast based multicast service.&nbsp; And, also, we did make sure
the avoid of packet transmission at the entry router of the (unicast) routing
loop, to avoid the network congestion due to the unicast routing loop.

<LI>
The jitter of packet transmission delay observed by each recievers with
the multicast transmission might be larger than that with the unicast transmission.
Some applications, such as a video transmission, are sensitive to the delay
jitter. The jitter of packet transmission delay should be evaluated.&nbsp;
The evaluation should include the case where we use the actual delay jitter
sentitive applications (e.g., DV transmission).&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
The robustness and stability of multicast routing protocol against the
high offered load by the user packet flows.&nbsp; The routing protocol
should correctly operate even when the network is in congestion.</LI>

<LI>
We should evaluate the effectiveness of the packet scheduling mechanism
to provide different quality of service among system control information
(e.g., routing protocol information) and user information.</LI>
