		<p><b>Office of the Ombudsman</b></p>
<p><b>Case 13-00058</b></p>
<p><b>In a matter of a Complaint by AB</b></p>
<p><b>Report dated August 2013</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This investigation has become a complicated mixture of a complaint about comments made on an ICANN mailing list, which on further investigation also resulted in a complaint about an election process, from the person the subject of the mailing list complaint. I deal with those separately, but the two matters are to some extent intermingled. The second complaint however appears to have resolved by other means.</p>
<p>I quote, with redactions to avoid identification of the individuals and organisation, the message which was posted on the mailing list.</p>
<p>“Having worked with the (name of body) and the (government department) in the past, and having maintained a relationship with senior members of each subsequently, I&#8217;m certain that whatever CD is up to is unlikely to be consistent with the public interest in public health in the (name) market of ideas and names.</p>
<p>C has always struck me as one of the least intelligent, and least principled persons to have ever been on the (name) Council.”</p>
<p>The complainant found this offensive and asked for the posting to be removed from the archive because it breached the relevant rules of procedure. I have not identified the rules of procedure from the supporting organisation, again because it identifies the individuals without difficulty. The complaint was made on behalf of the person identified.</p>
<p><b>Facts</b></p>
<p>The essence of the complaint is whether the comments made are offensive, and whether they should be removed. I understand the comments have already been removed in any event. So the issue is whether it was appropriate for the comments to have been made and whether they are offensive.</p>
<p><b>Investigation</b></p>
<p>It is my common practice on issues involving personalities to strongly urge the parties to join in a mediation. The first part of my investigation therefore consisted of an attempt to persuade the person who made the statement, to join in such a mediation. This was a protracted exercise, because the statement maker did not focus on the specific issue, and chose only to respond to certain parts of my enquiries. This is a pity, because of people do not engage in the process, it is difficult to achieve a resolution that restores some degree of harmony within the supporting organisation.</p>
<p>The statement maker was invited to retract and apologise for the statements, by a community leader, in a message which said as follows:-</p>
<p>“Upon the request of XY, Chair of the (Organisation), your posting rights to the (name) mailing list and (name) wiki have been suspended.</p>
<p>Per the Chair, your account can be reactived if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. You apologize for the (date) comment to the aggrieved party CC&#8217;ing the Chair and Secretary of (name);</p>
<p>2. You re-apply for unaffiliated (name) membership following the proper procedures; and</p>
<p>3. (name) review this case and reach a consensus.</p>
<p>Please also find attached a copy of the (name) Code of Conduct for your review.”</p>
<p>Regrettably, there has been no apology, although the membership issue appears to have been resolved by other means. His initial response was to question who had make the complaint, and when and where. I then specifically put the comment to him, identified by date, person and place. He declined to discuss the matter, and I was not able to persuade him to join a mediation. His primary response was that he thought that there was no complainant, but subsequently would not engage in a discussion about the comment posted on the mailing list, nor would he discuss whether the offensive comment was something which should be removed or apologise. This effectively frustrated any attempt to reach a more conciliatory settlement of the issue. I therefore notified him that I would prepare a formal report about the complaint and send him a copy in due course.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of any doubt, I consider it quite clear that the comment made was offensive by any standard. There is no doubt that on many mailing lists, there is often robust discussion about the issues currently before the organisation. But there are specific rules about content and standards of behaviour, which have been in place for some time.</p>
<p><b>Jurisdiction</b></p>
<p>This is a matter where I clearly have jurisdiction. An unfairness results when someone is offensively criticised in a mailing list within part of an ICANN supporting organisation. The unfairness is compounded when the statement maker refuses to engage in a conciliatory process.</p>
<p><b>Reasoning</b></p>
<p>The complainant’s issue is the statements made on the mailing list were offensive. The identification and investigation of this as being offensive was not difficult. Normally, as I have cited earlier, a mediation or conciliation process should resolve issues like this. Comments made in the heat of debate are sometimes inappropriate, but usually the parties can be persuaded to withdraw and apologise. I am conscious from my work as a mediator, that parties under stress sometimes act inappropriately. I would have liked to investigate whether there was some stress factor which influenced the statement maker to make the offensive comments. I am confident that if there had been some explanation based on some background, that the complainant would have been satisfied with a retraction and apology. The statement maker however has chosen not to engage in the process. I have little difficulty therefore in finding that the statements were offensive, and hopefully by now removed. The resulting suspension of the statement maker is understandable in the light of such refusal. I do not consider that the suspension was unfair and no circumstances. I would strongly suggest to the statement maker, that engaging in the mediation process would be more productive in the future. It may be that he has some views about the mediation process, but he is also aware of the standards of behaviour expected, when making postings on this mailing list.</p>
<p><b>Result</b></p>
<p>As a result of this investigation, I consider the reaction of the organisation in suspending the posting privileges was an appropriate response and not unfair. I will be posting this report on my website, because it is appropriate to remind those within the ICANN world, that there are standards of behaviour and that they should be respected. It is also important to note that such interpersonal criticism is in my view, best resolved with a mediation process, where the parties can engage in constructive discussions, and apologise where needed. It is important to be inclusive, but where there are breaches of the standards of behaviour, then sanctions do need to be made.</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>I am re-posting the resolution from the Board</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Reappointment of Ombudsman</h4>
<p>Whereas, the Ombudsman&#8217;s initial term concludes on 27 July 2013.</p>
<p>Whereas, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the Ombudsman performance and compensation, has recommended that the Board reappoint Chris LaHatte as the Ombudsman for another two-year term.</p>
<p>Whereas, the current Ombudsman has agreed to serve another term if appointed.</p>
<p>Resolved (2013.07.17.11), in accordance with Article V, Section 1.2 of the <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> Bylaws, the Board hereby reappoints Chris LaHatte as the <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> Ombudsman for a second two-year term from 28 July 2013 through 27 July 2015, and authorizes the General Counsel and Secretary to execute an agreement with Mr. LaHatte.</p>
<h4><a id="2.a.rationale" name="2.a.rationale"></a>Rationale for Resolution 2013.07.17.11</h4>
<p><abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>&#8216;s Bylaws require <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> to maintain an Office of the Ombudsman. See Article V of the Bylaws at <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#V">http://www.icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#V</a>. Having an <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>Ombudsman positively affects the transparency and accountability of <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> as the Ombudsman is one of the three main accountability mechanisms within <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>. <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>&#8216;s current Ombudsman is familiar with and well versed in the complex issues now facing<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>, including the New <abbr title="generic Top Level Domain">gTLD</abbr> Program and other initiatives currently under way. Mr. LaHatte&#8217;s caseload continues to increase over time, as both the nature of <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>&#8216;s activities and the breadth of the <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> community expand. Maintaining continuity in the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office with Mr. LaHatte, who is known and respected by members of the<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> community, is important to <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>&#8216;s accountability.</p>
<p>As there has been a budget for an <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> Ombudsman since 2004 when the first Ombudsman was appointed this decision does not have any financial impact on <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>, the community or the public that was not already anticipated or included in the budget. This decision will not have any impact on the security, stability or resiliency of the domain name system.</p>
<p>This is an Organizational Administrative Function that does not require public comment.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Objections for String .gay by GOProud</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have received a complaint in relation to the rejection of an objection to the string .gay lodged by the community group called GOProud. The objection was filed within time but then rejected because it exceeded the prescribed word length, by approximately 500 words. The notice of the rejection was sent to an email address which was not the one used to file the objection, and therefore notice of the rejection arrived later than expected, which meant that the amended objection was then not filed on time. GOProud made some enquiries about progress of their objection and assert they did not get any response until they were told the objection had been rejected. They make the point that if the rejection had been sent to the correct email address, they could have easily lodged the amended objection within time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am concerned about the fairness of such a decision to reject the objection, when there appears to be a valid reason why notice of the initial rejection was not received. It is of course possible for the objector and the applicant to meet to discuss the objection, which is contemplated by the objection process outlined in the guidebook. However my concern as the ombudsman, is that there is some unfairness in the subsequent rejection given the apparent error in the use of the wrong email. It seems to me that it would be relatively easy to unwind that decision, and permit the late filing of the objection. I can of course only make a recommendation, but in this case where there is some unfairness I think the matter should be revisited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact me if you have any queries about this matter. I believe a quick decision does need to be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have sent a copy of this letter to the objector and to the applicant. I have already offered to facilitate or mediate the objection, but the position of GOProud is that they want the objection in place before they would consider such a process. Given the unfairness in the rejection, that does not seem to be an unreasonable position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

		<p><b>Office of the Ombudsman</b></p>
<p><b>Case 13-00111</b></p>
<p><b>In a matter of a Complaint by AB</b></p>
<p><b>Report dated   10th June 2012</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This investigation began with a complaint about the objection process to the new gTLD Programme, and specifically a complaint that an objection was actually filed late, in that it was filed after midnight, and received late by the complainant (despite some amelioration of the strictness of the time limit). The significance of the objection process is that the Applicant Guidebook and procedure for the programme factored in the ability for affected individuals to object to applications for particular new gTLDs on a number of grounds. These include string confusion, legal rights objections, limited public interest objections and community objections. Once the objection had been filed then the applicant must respond to the objection, because otherwise the objector would prevail by default. Provided the objection was correctly lodged, and the applicant responded, then the objection would be handled by a panel of qualified experience depending on the category of objection.</p>
<p><b>Facts</b></p>
<p>The essence of this complaint is that objections were filed late, and it is the position of the complainant that it should not face an objection where the objector was unable to file an objection within the required time. The complainant said that when the objection was copied to them, it was clear the objection had been received at 12:01 a.m. on 14 March 2013 although the Applicant Guidebook stated that the objection had to be filed by midnight on 13 March 2013. On investigation, the applicant then discovered that the dispute resolution provider, in this case ICC, had conferred with other dispute resolution providers and agreed to permit a five minute window after midnight on 13<sup>th</sup> March, and that it would accept objections during that window. The applicant says specifically about the timing of the objection-</p>
<p>“That means, the employee tasked with the job of filing the objection pressed the send button after midnight, to be precise at 00:01:02 Thursday 14 March 2013 (UTC). I attach the report from (expert) which clearly shows this. The objection was then received by us at 00:04:54 Thursday 14 March 2013 (UTC).”</p>
<p>The complainant was concerned that I note that the objection was actually sent after the filing deadline, and not immediately before and then received late due to the process of sending taking more time.</p>
<p>The complainant then contacted ICANN and subsequently discovered that the providers had conferred among themselves, and was later advised that ICANN did not intervene or give any advice about the five minute window. The complainant has also expressed some frustration that it endeavoured to make enquiries to ICANN about the decision, but had no response. The complainant indicates that this is why it has chosen to ask the ombudsman to investigate this issue.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the objector is a competing applicant, and this needs to be factored into what has happened. The complainant considered that this meant the objector acted in bad faith, by lodging the objection at the very last possible time.</p>
<p>I have discussed this with ICANN staff and was told decisions about the window were left entirely to the dispute resolution providers, and that ICANN did not participate in the decision, and accepted the decision. The perception seems to be from outside observers, that ICANN endorsed this decision, but certainly my investigation indicates that ICANN staff accepted a decision rather than say that it was right or wrong, which would be my understanding of endorsement. The complainant noted to me</p>
<p>“As we have already indicated, we did receive insight from Christine Willet as to ICANN’s decision making process, during webinars and presentations in which Ms. Willet was involved. Essentially the DRSPs asked ICANN for its view on late filed objections, ICANN responded that the DRSPs should decide amongst themselves, but be consistent. The DRSPs then unilaterally decided to extend the previously communicated deadline (after it had passed), presented this solution to ICANN, which agreed.”</p>
<p><b>Investigation</b></p>
<p>To undertake this investigation I have undertaken a number of steps. In particular I discussed this with the applicant with an exchange of emails, I have talked to Christine Willett (VP gTLD Operations) and legal staff at ICANN, and I have also made a call for comments on my blog and Twitter feed. I believe it is important that the community should comment on this issue, both from the perspective of applicants and of objectors. I am grateful to those who have made comments, which have been thoughtful and useful. I am conscious that there have been very substantial investments in the applications, but also of course recognise that objectors also consider that they have economic and other interests affected by awarding a new gTLD to applicants.</p>
<p><b>Issues</b></p>
<p>The issue which I am required to investigate is the fairness of the decision to permit the filing of the objection within the additional window and beyond the limit prescribed in the Applicant Handbook.</p>
<p><b>Jurisdiction</b></p>
<p>This is a matter where I do need to carefully consider the jurisdiction to investigate the complaint. My jurisdiction is limited to issues between ICANN and the ICANN community. The issue is therefore whether a dispute resolution provider, contracted by ICANN to evaluate objections, can be subject of an investigation by the ombudsman in relation to fairness. Put in another way, is the dispute resolution provider a member of the ICANN community? My jurisdiction is excluded for certain types of contractual relationship with the bylaws says “or issues related to vendor/supplier relations”. However that sort of contractual relationship is intended to deal with issues of procurement rather than the more complex arrangements made in the context of the gTLD programme. The complainant did make the point that ICANN was consulted during the course of the discussion about loosening the rigour of the time for objection. So in the context of the purpose of the exclusion, I do believe that I have jurisdiction. Certainly the applicant/ complainant submitted that I did, and should investigate the decision.</p>
<p><b>Reasoning</b></p>
<p>The modern test for dealing with issues of fairness also encompasses the concept of proportionality. In his correspondence with me, the applicant/complainant did say, quoting from the NTAG meeting in Beijing “&#8221;The DRSP&#8217;s amongst themselves discussed this issue. And due to their own system issues, the synchronization of clocks around the world, and concerns they had, they elected to extend their window by five minutes and accept objections that were filed, according to some clocks in some parts of the world, five minutes after the deadline.&#8221; The point that needs to be emphasised is that the objection is not by any means fatal to the success of any of the applications. It is simply a step which has to be undertaken and answered during the course of a long and complex process. In the context of proportionality, and considering the issue of fairness I would pose the question, is it better for the community that applications are properly challenged and debated and succeed therefore on the merits, or should a more prescriptive approach be adopted?</p>
<p>There have been a number of comments made in relation to this issue on blog sites which make it clear that some members of the community have strong views about a prescriptive approach. One comment was “people have spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars on their applications. A technicality should not determine the outcome.” But another comment was that filing an objection late was not a technicality. Other objectors have agreed commenting that a strict approach should be adopted.</p>
<p>However I also need to bear in mind that my jurisdiction is limited to making a recommendation about the process, which would be to recommend that either a strict approach be adopted or that the decision of the dispute resolution providers is proportionate to the issue. Even if I were to recommend the strict approach, it is open to the dispute resolution providers to maintain their position about the five minute window.</p>
<p>It would also be open for me to suggest to the board that they suspend the objection process, a course urged upon me by this applicant. While I cannot predict what they would decide, I think it likely that they would respect the decision of the dispute resolution providers. The dispute resolution providers are independent, and make their own decisions. For the board to interfere would be controversial.</p>
<p>Of course it would be open to me to comment on the fairness or otherwise of such decisions. Given the circumstances described by the providers and discussed at Beijing, it is my view that a five minute window is a proportionate response and does not create unfairness for the applicants, but does provide fairness given that it is only five minutes. I am told that some objections received later were in fact rejected. I am directly aware of least one. That is perhaps not surprising, in the context of a decision about a five minute window.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that sending an objection by the competing applicant for the same string is perhaps a different matter from an objection by a detached observer. I do not believe that this somehow taints the objection because the very process anticipates objections from competing applicants. They had a right to object, and exercised that right, if a little tardily. But in the context of the decision to accept within a five minute window, then the objection is properly lodged.</p>
<p><b>Result</b></p>
<p>As a result of this investigation, I consider that the decision of the dispute resolution providers to permit the five minute window does not create unfairness for the applicant and is a proportionate response. In addition I do not consider that the sending, and for the DRP to accept the objection, of the objection, within the window is unfair.</p>

		<p>I have had a number of complaints about the action of the dispute resolution providers in accepting some objections past the deadline. It appears that these come into two categories, some with very large attachments to emails which were sent before the deadline, but which took some time to transmit, meaning the final parts were sent late. In addition some were sent minutes after the deadline due to technical difficulties. Two complainants have both made a formal complaint to my office stating that I should recommend to the board that late complaints should not be received on the basis that the deadlines were well advertised and achievable. It appears from my discussions that there appears to have been a window of a a few moments permitted by the dispute resolution providers. It should also be added that ICANN did not approve or disapprove the leeway given by the dispute resolution providers. I am interested to hear community comments on this issue. One of the complainants specifically suggested a blog entry, and I have also made a Twitter comment. I look forward to hearing from you either here, on Twitter or to ombudsman@icann.org. Full confidentiality is of course assured if you wish this.</p>

		<p>One of the features of the regular ICANN meeting is the public forum which is now held on Thursday afternoon, the last day of the meeting. This is an occasion where the voice of the people can be heard, and the only restriction on the topic is that the speakers must limit their address to 2 minutes and comply with the ICANN rules about Expected Standards of Behaviour. These are “Treat all members of the ICANN community equally, irrespective of nationality, gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age, or sexual orientation; members of the ICANN community should treat each other with civility both face to face and online.”</p>
<p>So provided the speaker respects those standards, then they are free to speak. This means that the speaker can discuss anything of concern to them. This is perhaps a poignant issue, when the meeting is held in a country where the freedom to speak is not given the same importance as some other participant countries in the ICANN community.</p>
<p>There is often an issue of not wishing to offend a host. But underlying this is sometimes the need to respect freedom of speech. During the ICANN meeting there was an incident where someone tried to speak inappropriately at an earlier meeting, where they were off topic. This resulted in two complaints to my office, over the next day. One of those was from the speaker and the other from a participant in the meeting, who was concerned about a perception that the speaker had been treated badly by not being able to speak. I explained carefully both to the speaker, and to the other complainant, that the initial forum at which he tried to speak was the wrong place, because he was off topic. I explained that we did have the public forum where he could express his views freely. I then made a specific arrangement so that he would be able to speak at the forum and that he also understood the rules about expected standards of behaviour. He completely understood this issue and did explain to me why he wanted to talk.</p>
<p>So in due course on Thursday, he arranged for someone to talk for the 2 minutes on this topic and was pleased to have been given the opportunity.</p>
<p>Sometimes things like freedom of speech are taken for granted, when it is an accepted part of our community. Not all places offer the same freedom, and within the world of ICANN, we can assist in ensuring that there is free and open discussion. I was pleased to be able to assist this person. Otherwise of course this would have been unfair.</p>

		<p>Today is the 1st official day of the full ICANN meeting in Beijing. We began with the traditional opening ceremony and another aspirational and inspiring speech from Fadi Chehade on the management tools which he is developing to ensure our bottom-up stakeholders model works with the open and transparent knowledge of what ICANN staff are actually doing. I am not part of that management system of course, because of the confidential nature of the complaints which come into my office. My new case management software however will do much the same for me, to more efficiently handle the increasing workload and respond better to my visitors. It has already been a little busy in my office with a range of complaints, some possibly quite controversial. I am shortly closing my afternoon clinic, to attend the Internet governance update. This proves to be a very topical issue and I am keen to see the latest developments. The ICANN ombudsman does have a role in the governance of ICANN, because of the particular function of fairness in the way in our multi stakeholder organisation works, and as a symbol to the community that they have an independent outlet if they feel the structure is not working. So I am keen to learn from the latest developments.</p>

		<p>On Monday 18th March I had the privilege of listening to Professor John Uff QC talk about engineering ethics. He is a civil engineer with a specialty in geotechnics, an Emeritus Professor of Engineering Law at King’s College, London, a global authority on construction law and a Queen’s Counsel. He has served as Vice President of the London Court of International Arbitration and as President of the Society of Construction Arbitrators. I cannot think of many who are as well qualified to discuss this issue! My interest was sparked because I have been asked to comment on ethical issues from time to time. The whole concept of fairness must ultimately be based on ethical considerations, which for professionals, are often described in codes. Professor Uff was invited to address the New Zealand Institute of Professional Engineers, who extended the invitation to lawyers and members of the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute.</p>
<p>The reason Professor Uff was invited was the discussion of ethical duties of engineers arising from the 2 major disasters in New Zealand, relating to engineering failure. The 1st was the Christchurch earthquake and subsequent after-shocks, and the 2nd was the Pike River coal mine explosion. The fact this has caused the New Zealand engineers to reappraise the duties which engineers owed to the public as expressed in their code of ethics, and Professor Uff has written extensively on the subject.</p>
<p>At ICANN we do not have a formal code of ethics for the operation of the domain name system. There are a number of elements however which collectively are the start of such code. The very creation of ICANN as a not-for-profit multi-stakeholder organisation separates it from purely commercial enterprises. The existence of the office of the ombudsman to deal with issues of fairness, delay and diversity does make ICANN different,  and the Ombudsman have also adopted the standards of practice for online dispute resolution. Frank Fowlie also developed the statement for respectful communication. ICANN also has similar guidelines within the communities which make up ICANN. More recently, ICANN has proposed a new draft of Registrants’ Rights and Responsibilities, which is akin to a code of ethics. I have suggested the Ombudsman should have a specific role in this code. Professor Uff did warn the meeting however, that we should not create codes of ethics as a reaction to a problem or in the case of the engineering disasters, as a response to such major calamities. Fortunately at ICANN there has not been a significant issue, except of course this draft was developed because of the new GTLD program. This is different from the engineering code issues, but is analogous because it is a reaction to the event. I am hoping there will be some debate, at Beijing and further, on the use of such a code and perhaps a wider debate.</p>

		<p>A case management system is probably not something which attracts much discussion or interest among my readers. ICANN itself has recently moved into the use of a sophisticated project management system to assist with collaboration and planning of work. The office of the ombudsman has had a useful case management system, but unfortunately it has become somewhat outdated. So I have been spending a considerable amount of time recently in researching new systems, and evaluating the products available.</p>
<p>I have now had my new system approved by ICANN and also by our security team, an important element because of my need for confidentiality. I have been spending time with the vendor to create the different alternatives and tools to work with the system, which I hope will enable faster handling of complaints and better reports as to the issues which I am handling. I am incorporating within the system a project management option so that when more complex complaints are received they can be handled with appropriate templates and milestones to assist in a better product.</p>
<p>The interface, for people who want to lodge a complaint, will not change greatly. What I hope to achieve is a system which will enable much more information to be provided, and which will process the complaints more actively. While many of my complaints continue to be outside my jurisdiction, nonetheless they needed to be considered and appropriate referrals made to the correct place to consider the issue. I believe my visitors prefer to know quickly whether I am able to deal with their complaint or whether it has to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>So on the face of it nothing will have any substantial changes, but within about two months we should have a new system with greater analysis and efficiency available.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not very exciting, but I am sharing this so that my visitors know that the engine is being lifted and replaced by the 2013 model. The driver remains however as the 1954 model.</p>

		<p>It is not unusual for me to receive complaints about intemperate or rude comments made within the ICANN community. Some years ago Frank Fowlie produced a most useful paper on the subject which is now placed on my pages at http://www.icann.org/en/help/ombudsman/respectful-communication. There are of course other policies within ICANN which consider similar issues. It is quite understandable when people are passionate about their ideas and policies, that they will occasionally step over the line and send an email or make a post, which often they will subsequently regret. Sadly the nature of the Internet is that sometimes these comments become embedded and impossible to remove because they have been repeated. I suspect in a number of cases the person who made the intemperate comment greatly regrets having done so, but is powerless to remove the trail.I have been following articles about someone who deliberately chooses to make critical, controversial and often very hurtful comments, and sadly this person is located in my own country of New Zealand. Apparently he is aged eighteen. I have a certain experience with teenagers, and understand how the mouth is often engaged before the brain is placed into gear. But one of the lubricants which makes society work is respect for the views of others. Perhaps politeness is regarded as an old-fashioned virtue, and certainly my parents told me that I must be polite. In the dark ages when I was a teenager, I am sure that I did not comply with the requests to be polite. But fortunately any comments I made were not embedded in the darker interstices of the Internet. Now this young New Zealand troll has achieved notoriety throughout the world by intemperate and hurtful comments, which apparently he claims are social experiments.I expect that he is pleased with all of the attention but I rather doubt that we are to see a considered academic consideration of his experiment. I am all for strong debate. But Frank Fowlie&#8217;s paper has a continued relevance, although I doubt that the eighteen-year-old has read this in preparation for his social experiment.</p>
