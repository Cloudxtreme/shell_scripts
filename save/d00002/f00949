        Evaluator - Technical</span></p>
      <p>The evaluation of sTLD applications will be based upon submitted information 
        concerning the Registry Operator's proposed technical solution. The application 
        should demonstrate that the applicant has carefully analyzed the technical

      <p> A panel member should have the ability to evaluate sTLD application 
        based on the criteria below. That ability should be born of skills and 
        experiences developed through the implementation, management and design 
        of complex systems and demonstrated, at both standard-protocol and operational 
        levels, understanding of the subtle features of the Domain Name System 
        and how they are specified and work.
