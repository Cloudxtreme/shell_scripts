<P>

We have received a small grant from NSF to provide technical assistance
to people setting up networks in developing areas that will provide
links for collaboration with US scientists.  The networking tools and
facilities and engineering information databases we are constructing
are oriented toward start-up assistance, and include both one-on-one
assistance and accumulated archives of relevant files (see below).
<P>

Beyond that, it may be easier to describe our area of specialization by
pointing out some activities in which we are not engaging.  Our file
archives are intended to complement, not compete with, the archives of
information about networks in various areas of the world being
maintained by Larry Landweber and Larry Press, among others.  Our
efforts are oriented toward network engineering.  For example, there is
little point asking us whether there are network connections in
location X unless you are prepared, with some technical assistance, to
take an active role in starting one if one does not exist.  To put this
differently, the best sources of information about network availability
in various locations remain the usual publications, the lists and
archives, various directories and servers, and the info-nets list.
Similarly, the best internet source for information about general
development issues remains DEVEL-L and related lists.
<P>

We have no dollars to distribute.  We are willing to pass rumors about
people or organizations who might, but don't get your hopes up.  Our
philosophy is that it has become sufficiently inexpensive to put up a
network node that the engineering knowledge, will, and tools are the
major obstacles.  Hence, the major foci of our attack are knowledge and
tools, with advice, support, and sympathy served on the side.
<P>

Because of this start-up orientation, our "network" emphasis also tends
to be at the lower end: closer to connections using cans and wet string
than to multi-megabit links, although we are quite happy to use
whatever we can get.  We believe that the low-end technology has
advanced to the point that any competent scientifically trained
individual can set up a low-cost network host capable of communicating
with others (typically Fidonet, UUCP, or SLIP/PPP), and that the main
obstacle is the lack of easily available adequate documentation and
easily installed tools aimed toward that type of person, a known place
where they can be referred to appropriate technical help with the
tools, as well as an unwarranted degree of mystery about the process.
<P>

If questions appear on info-nets or DEVEL-L on topics within the scope
of this effort or in which we have special expertise, we will respond:
no special additional effort is needed.  
<P>

The archives of text files can be browsed by connecting to the gopher at 
gopher.psg.com (curently 147.28.0.34). Tools, startup kits, and more text
files are available from ftp.psg.com (currently 147.28.0.33).  The ftp
archive can be accessed through a mail-based server.  Send mail to
server@ftp.psg.com with "help" as the message body for more
information.  We are also willing to send tools and books by post to
developing areas with no current network access.
<P>

Naturally, we are actively soliciting new documentation about entry
level networking, tools, kits, and gossip about connectivity to the
developing regions.
<P>
If you need to reach us directly, the preferred mailing address is
lowcost-net@psg.com or, if you prefer, lowcost-net@infoods.unu.edu.
