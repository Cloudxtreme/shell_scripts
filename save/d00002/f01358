<a name="project_goals">
<h3>Project goals</h3>
</a>
<p>
Arla is a free AFS implementation.<br> The main goal is to make a
fully functional client with all capabilities of AFS as formerly
sold by Transarc and today available as OpenAFS.
Other stuff, such as servers and management tools are being developed,
but currently not considered stable.
</p>

<a name="supported_platforms">
<h3>Supported platforms</h3>
</a>
<p>
The currently supported platforms are:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>: Arla 0.43 on 5.1 - 5.5
  <li> <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>: Arla 0.43 on 2.x, and 3.0
  <li> <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>: Arla 0.43 on 2.4.x to 2.6.15, Arla 0.90 on 2.6.16 and beyond
  <li> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>: Arla 0.90 on 10.4
</ul>
The support for those should be pretty up-to-date as the developers work on them.<br>
Platforms on which arla should work but which are untested for some reason include:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> <em>for details, see their documentation</em>
</ul>
Please submit build and test reports!<br>
Platforms with some of the work made, but which are not fully supported:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">Windows</a> 2000 and newer
  <li> <a href="http://www.sun.com/solaris/">Solaris</a>
  <li> AIX 4
  <li> IRIX 6
  <li> HPUX
  <li> SunOS 4.1.x
  <li> Other versions of the supported platforms.
</ul> 
</p>

<a name="project_status">
<h3>Project status</h3>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Working stable client (currently caching files from the start up to where you read)
  <li> Authentication (with <a href="http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/">Heimdal</a>)
  <li> Used in production systems with FreeBSD, NetBSD and Linux.
  <li> Some administration programs (fs, vos, pts and bos)
  <li> An experimental AFS server (milko)
  <li> Graphical program <i>amon</i> for monitoring the state of the cache.
  <li> A graphical interface for managing ACLs
</ul>
<p>
If you find this useful and want to speed things up, have you
considered contributing your time and efforts to this project? But you
don't quite know how to start?
<ul>
  <li> Subscribe to <a href="#mailing_lists"> arla-drinkers list</a>
  <li> Have a look at <i>README</i> and <i>TODO</i> files in the 
       <a href="#distribution"> distribution </a>
  <li> The utilities (vos, pts and others) have subcommands which are not
       implemented yet. 
  <li> You are a regular user of Arla on platforms other than 
       NetBSD or Linux on i386. For example Linux/alpha,
       NetBSD/vax, OpenDarwin or any other platform we might
       have not thought about. We would like to hear from you
       and to be able to tell you when there is a new release
       "around the corner".
</ul>
<p>

<a name="distribution">
<h3>Distribution</h3>
</a>
<p>
A link to the current release can be found in the sidebar. 
Or look around in 
<a href="ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/arla/"> 
the arla directory on our ftp server</a>. If you have AFS,
you can of course go directly
<a href="file:///afs/stacken.kth.se/ftp/pub/arla/"> 
to the source in AFS</a>.
</p>

<p>Sometimes we make snapshots of the sources and put it on our
ftp-server at <a href="ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/arla/snap/">
ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/arla/snap/</a>. Those sources are not
guaranteed to work.</p>

<p>Since AFS uses the Kerberos system for authentication, you really
want to build Arla with Kerberos support. You should be able to build
Arla without Kerberos, just losing some functionality in the process,
but only very few people do that. We are building and using Arla with
<a href="http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/"> Heimdal </a>, and we do
recommend it. Building with other Kerberos distributions (like MIT
Kerberos or CNS) might also be possible, but you will at least need
the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/openafs/krbafs/">krbafs</a> library.
The easiest way to get Arla to work with other Kerberos
implementations is to build and link statically with heimdal and then
use your <em>existing</em> Kerberos binaries to provide the
authentication token.
</p>

<p>
A pkg is available for NetBSD (net/arla).
</p>

<p>
The RPMs are old, but here they are:
<br>
<a href="suse91.html">SuSE 9.1</a>
<br>
<a href="redhat.html">Red Hat</a>
</p>

<p>
We are told that you can find 
<a href="https://lists.stacken.kth.se/pipermail/arla-drinkers/2007-January/004071.html">
Debian packages</a>.
</p>

<p>
Binary Mac OS X Tiger packages are available:

<h3>Documentation</h3>
</a>

There's not much documentation about Arla at the moment.  Some
documentation is included in the distribution. Here are 
some pointers to relevant AFS documentation: <p>

<ul>
<li> Arla documentation from the distribution in 
     <a href=html/arla.html> HTML </a> and 
     <a href=html/arla.pdf> PDF </a> format.
<li> A brief Arla <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/arla/prog-afs/">AFS's
programmers manual</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/hi/plutonic/afs-faq.html">AFS Faq</a>
<li> A Usenix Freenix track 
     <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/freenix/arla2.ps">
     paper</a>, Usenix technical conference 1998 that Johan Danielsson
     and Assar Westerlund presented. There was also some
     <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/freenix/arla1.ps">
     slides</a>.

<li> A conference called
     <a href="http://www.chips.chalmers.se/Chips/conference/made2000/">
     Made2000</a> - Management and Administration of Distributed
     Environments, in Gothenburg, Sweden 2000 we presented a <a
     href="made2000.ps">paper</a> about porting Arla to Windows. There
     was also some <a href="made2000-presentation.ps">slides</a>.

</ul>

<a name="cvs_tree">
<h3>CVS tree</h3>
</a>

The CVS tree for Arla is located in AFS and is world-readable.  The
CVSROOT is /afs/stacken.kth.se/src/SourceRepository.  You need a
version of CVS that doesn't try to create lock files.  If you don't
have one, a patch relative to cvs-1.10 is available <a
href="cvs-nolock.diff">here</a>.  With that you can checkout the arla
code with a command such as:

<font size=-1><pre>
cvs -R -d /afs/stacken.kth.se/src/SourceRepository checkout arla
</pre></font>

Another way to access the cvs-tree is from the computer
<em>anoncvs.stacken.kth.se</em>. Its recommended that set the
enviroment-variable CVS_RSH to ssh.

<font size=-1><pre>
env CVS_RSH=ssh \
cvs -d anoncvs&#x0040;anoncvs.stacken.kth.se:/stacken-cvs checkout arla
</pre></font>

This repository is rsync:ed with the real one every hour, fifteen
minutes over.

For building from the CVS tree, please see the file HACKING.

<p>You can also access the cvs-tree though 
<a href="http://cvsweb.stacken.kth.se/cvsweb.cgi/arla/">cvsweb</a>

   <p>
   In the README there is a section what `arla' means:

<pre>
- Arla in Swedish means `early'.  Most of the code has been written
early in the morning.

- Arla is also the name of the largest producer of dairy products in
Sweden.  They produce, among others, a milk product called `fil'
(filmjölk = sour milk) which also happens to be the swedish word for
`file'.
