      <p>The ICANN Nominating Committee (NomCom) invites the participation of 

        the Internet community in a new process to select well-qualified, accomplished 

        individuals to serve in three sets of leadership positions in ICANN. 

        NomCom is looking for individuals who have demonstrated the maturity, 

        experience, knowledge and skills to handle the tasks and make the judgments 

        involved in fulfilling the roles of Board Directors, Generic Names Supporting 

        Organization (GNSO) Council Members and Interim At Large Advisory Committee 

        (ALAC) Members.</p>

      <p>We invite both (1)&nbsp;Recommendations of persons to be considered and 

        (2)&nbsp;Statements of Interest from persons who wish to be considered 

        for the following positions: eight seats on the Board of Directors, three 

        seats on the GNSO, and five seats on the Interim ALAC. NomCom will use 

        the criteria and eligibility factors described below in <a href="#F">Section 

        F</a> to make its selections.</p>

      <p>The NomCom welcomes your active participation in this new nominating 

        process and will be grateful for the valuable input it hopes to receive.</p>

      <p>If you would like to receive NomCom announcements, please send an e-mail 

        with the text &quot;subscribe nomcom.announce&quot; to &lt;<a href="mailto:nomcom.announce-request@icann.org">nomcom.announce-request@icann.org</a>&gt;.</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b><a name="NomComanditsProcess"></a>NomCom and its Process</b></p>

        <p>The objective of ICANN's new nominating committee process is to balance 

          the Supporting Organization-based and constituency-based selection of 

          Directors and individuals for other positions to ensure that ICANN can 

          benefit from participants of the highest integrity and capability who 

          place the public interest ahead of any particular interests, but who 

          are nevertheless knowledgeable about the environment in which ICANN 

          operates.</p>

        <p>NomCom seeks widespread participation, through submission of Recommendations 

          and Statements of Interest, to find the talent and experience needed 

          for these roles, to inform NomCom's decisions, and to generate the confidence 

          and respect of the community for those who NomCom selects.</p>

        <p>Central to the NomCom process are the Statements of Interest received 

          from individuals who agree to be considered for service in any of the 

          above positions. A Statement of Interest needs to be completed in full 

          and received by the NomCom no later than 5 May 2003 (see <a href="#M">Section 

          M</a>: How and Where to Submit Statements of Interest ). A person who 

          has submitted the Statement of Interest is considered a Candidate for 

          selection by the NomCom. If the Statement of Interest is missing required 

          information, the individual will not be considered a Candidate for selection 

          by the NomCom.</p>

        <p>In order to enhance the Candidate pool from which NomCom will make 

          its selection, Recommendations are encouraged. If you would like to 

          recommend someone for NomCom consideration, please see <a href="#L">Section 

          L</a>: How, and Where to Submit Recommendations.</p>

        <p>NomCom members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet 

          community and within the scope of the ICANN Mission and the responsibilities 

          assigned to NomCom by the ICANN Bylaws. &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm</a>&gt;</p>

        <p>NomCom operates independently from the ICANN Board, the Supporting 

          Organizations, and Advisory Committees. The functional and geographic 

          diversity of NomCom members enable and encourage it to select persons 

          who are not beholden to any particular interests and are capable of 

          representing the broader view of the Internet Community.</p>

        <p>The Bylaws stipulate that the NomCom is responsible for the selection 

          of all ICANN Directors except the President and those selected by ICANN's 

          Supporting Organizations, and for such other selections as are set forth 

          in the Bylaws. [Article VII, Section 1 &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1</a>&gt;]</p>

        <p>NomCom selections are final; no further approval or ratification is 

          needed.</p>

        <p><b><a name="generalbylawshtmVII"></a>ICANN Mission</b></p>

        <p>The Mission of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 

          (&quot;ICANN&quot;) is to coordinate, at the overall level, the global 

          Internet's systems of unique identifiers, and in particular to ensure 

          the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique identifier 

          systems.</p>

        <p>In particular, ICANN:</p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p>1. Coordinates the allocation and assignment of the three sets of 

            unique identifiers for the Internet, which are</p>

          <blockquote> 

            <p>a. Domain names (forming a system referred to as the &quot;DNS&quot;);<br>

              b. Internet protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) addresses and autonomous system 

              (&quot;AS&quot;) numbers;<br>

              c. Protocol port and parameter numbers.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>2. Coordinates the operation and evolution of the DNS root name server 

            system.</p>

          <p>3. Coordinates policy development reasonably and appropriately related 

            to these technical functions.</p>

        <p>The term &quot;Nominee&quot; is reserved to refer to a Candidate selected

        <p>To ensure open and frank communication with the NomCom, we have paid 

          particular attention in our procedures to safeguarding confidentiality.</p>

        <p>Specifically, under our procedures all NomCom members will safeguard 

          all internal NomCom communications and treat them as strictly private, 

          confidential, and for the use of immediate committee members and NomCom 

          staff only, without exception.</p>

        <p>NomCom members will not disclose outside of the committee the identities 

          of Candidates under consideration by the NomCom, nor any discussions 

          about them, unless both the Candidate and the NomCom as a whole have 

          given explicit authorization to disclose the information.</p>

        <p>Note that because NomCom will need to check references and consult 

          selected third-party sources on a confidential basis before making its 

          final selections, those wishing to be considered as Candidates are required 

          to confirm this understanding of the confidentiality arrangements when 

          they submit a Statement of Interest. NomCom also reserves the right 

          to disclose the identities of those who submit Recommendations when 

          it is necessary to do so in the course of the review process.</p>

        <p>When NomCom has completed its selection of Nominees for the positions 

          it is charged to fill, NomCom will, of course, publish the identities 

          of the Nominees.</p>

        <p>Statistical information, without identifying information, may be published. 

          For example, information about the size and nature of the Candidate

        and Terms of Duty</b></font></p>

      <p>In early June 2003, the NomCom expects to make its final selection for 

        individuals to serve the 19 Terms of Duty that are associated with the 

        following 16 positions:</p>

      <ul>

        <li> 8 seats on the ICANN Board of Directors,</li>

        <li> 5 seats on the Interim ALAC (At-Large Advisory Committee), and</li>

        <li> 3 seats on the GNSO (Generic Names Supporting Organization) Council.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Associated with the above 16 seats, are 19 Terms of Duty (see below).</p>

      <p>Note that the start of the terms of duty for these positions is when 

        the New Board is seated. [Article XX, Section 2 (4) &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XX-2.4">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XX-2.4</a>&gt;] 

        We expect the New Board to be seated at the close of the ICANN meeting 

        in Montreal, 26 June 2003. This expected date is used in the tables below, 

        but may be subject to change.</p>

      <p>In selecting Nominees of the highest integrity and capability, the NomCom 

        will apply the criteria for selection and terms of eligibility, defined 

        in the applicable ICANN Bylaws, to identify a pool of qualified Candidates. 

        To select from this pool of qualified Candidates, NomCom will take into

        who place the public interest ahead of any particular special interests, 

        but who are nevertheless knowledgeable about the environment in which 

        ICANN operates.</p>

      <p>In doing so, the NomCom also implements ICANN's Core Values to seek and 

        support broad, informed participation reflecting the functional, geographic, 

        and cultural diversity of the Internet at all levels of policy development

              Directors (not including the President) who are citizens of countries 

              in any one Geographic Region to exceed five; and the NomCom shall

              since none of them has exceeded the three term limit as defined 

              in the Bylaws. Wong and Wilson are ineligible in 2003 by reason

        <p>The criteria for selection of the GNSO Council and At Large Advisory 

          Committee members are less specifically defined in the Bylaws, but the 

          NomCom notes the &quot;Legislative History&quot; behind the decision 

          for NomCom to select some individuals to the above committees. [ICANN: 

          A Blueprint for Reform, Section 3 (20 June 2002) &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/evol-reform/blueprint-20jun02.htm#3">http://www.icann.org/en/committees/evol-reform/blueprint-20jun02.htm#3</a>&gt;

        <p>NomCom is looking for individuals who have demonstrated the maturity, 

          experience, knowledge and skills to handle the tasks and make the judgments 

          involved in fulfilling the roles of Board Directors, GNSO Council Members 

          and ALAC Members.</p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i>1. Additional Considerations for the GNSO Council Positions</i></p>

          <p>For the GNSO Council positions, specific experience related to the 

            scope of GNSO's work with the Domain Name System would be advantageous, 

            whereas Country-Code TLD (ccTLD) and Regional Internet Registry (RIR) 

            familiarity would be less important for these positions.</p>

          <p><i>2. Additional Considerations for the Interim ALAC Positions</i></p>

          <p>For the ALAC positions, experience and skills that bear on gathering, 

            understanding, and communicating the interests of individual users 

            would be advantageous. Perspectives not otherwise reflected in the 

            existing ALAC membership would be advantageous. NomCom's selections 

            for ALAC are intended to diversify the skill and experience sets of 

            the ALAC, including in such areas as group decision-making. Over time 

            these NomCom selections present an opportunity to connect with the 

            interests of individual users from all categories.</p>

        to consider in the final round of review. For this purpose NomCom will 

        arrange, with consent of these candidates, to conduct confidential references 

        and credential verification and consult with others, not named by the 

        Candidate, on a confidential basis.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that this Nominating Committee process differs from 

        an election, although the goal is the same: to elicit the Internet community's 

        participation in a thoughtful process leading to the selection of very 

        well-qualified individuals to fulfill the specific roles of their positions.</p>

      <p>In this Nominating Committee process:</p>

      <p>Members of the Internet community will have the opportunity to recommend 

        individuals for the positions to be filled; members of the Internet 

        community will have the opportunity to volunteer to be considered for 

        the positions to be filled; those who submit a completed Statement of 

        Interest (&quot;Candidates&quot;) will have the opportunity to provide 

        NomCom with evidence of their suitability for the positions; careful due 

        diligence will be undertaken about the Candidates' qualifications and 

        reputations; the Internet community will have a mechanism to submit comments 

        to the NomCom about the process; and a set of frequently asked questions 

        with their answers will be posted on the NomCom website as the recruitment 

        and evaluation process progresses.</p>

      <p>Note that Endorsements by organizations or groups and lists of signatories 

        are not appropriate for this Nominating Committee process, and they will 

        not be influential in NomCom's selections since popularity is not one 

        of the criteria being used.</p>

      <p>The Bylaws stipulate that the NomCom is responsible for the selection 

        of all ICANN Directors except the President and those selected by ICANN's 

        Supporting Organizations, and for such other selections as are set forth 

        in the Bylaws. [Article VII, Section 1 &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1</a>&gt;].</p>

      <p> NomCom selections are final; no further approval or ratification is 

        needed.</p>

        will consult Candidates' references and do third-party reference checks

        the identities of the selected Candidates public. Although NomCom will 

        take reasonable steps to ensure that its confidentiality procedures are

        information is disclosed despite these procedures.</p>

      <p>By submitting a Statement of Interest, each Candidate authorizes the 

        NomCom to consult with the Candidate's references and do third-party reference 

        checks. Each Candidate also agrees that he or she is not entitled to review 

        or access any of the information received, generated, or considered by 

        the NomCom regarding any Candidate, or any of the NomCom's discussions
