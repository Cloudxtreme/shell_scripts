<h2>Activity 4. Infrastructure</h2>

Underpinning infrastructure elements were examined to ensure that the major
activities of the IPv6 for e-Business project have a solid foundation.
Utilising the IPv6-ready .au Domain Name Registry, these activities
assessed the status of infrastructure planning and development, and the
ability of Australian domain name service infrastructure to support
essential Internet accessibility.

<h3>4.1 Underpinning Infrastructure</h3> 

Click to see the document written especially for this project, 
<a href="underpin.php">Underpinning Infrastructure</a>, which has now
been recognised as a major contribution to examining 
issues currently affecting the acceptance, implementation and
future steps in deploying IPv6, in the areas of:

<ul>
<li> Address Allocation
<li> DNS Operations
<li> Transition Support
<li> E-Commerce
<li> Security Keys 
</ul>

 <hr> 


<h3>4.2 IPv6 Testbed Development</a></h3>

in collaboration with auDA and AusRegistry, the IPv6 for e-Business project
examined IPv6 connectivity, infrastructure and deployment restrictions related
to one of the most important of Internet accessibility functions - the
Domain Name System. <br /><br />

The .au Domain Administration Ltd (auDA) is the policy authority and industry
self-regulatory body for the .au domain space.  It is responsible for 
domain name services within the .au namespace, which provide stable
operation of the Internet in Australia.

<br /><br /> AusRegistry Pty Ltd provides the IT infrastructure to manage auDA
services for all current 'open' second-level Australian domain names: .com.au,
.net.au, .id.au, .asn.au and .org.au, plus the government (.gov.au) and
education domains (.edu.au). 

<br /><br />
During 2006 and 2007, auDA and AusRegistry enabled the registry to become capable of
providing IPv6 services. Further work will be required to examine the useability
and functionality of IPv6 in relation to the registry, given that IPv6 networks
world-wide are currently 'islands of connectivity' within the IPv4 Internet. 

<br /><br /> <hr> 

<h3>4.3 DNS Infrastructure and IPv6 Testing</h3>

In order to test a variety of applications against the DNS infrastructure a set
of instructions was provided to people and organisations with IPv6 connectivity.
The test revolved around the ability to resolve an .au IPv6-enabled website via
the AAAA records.

<br /><br /> Respondents stated that they conducted the tests on multiple platforms
using various web applications. The results were mixed, but overall the results
and feedback were positive, with the majority being able to connect to the IPv6
site via IPv6 transit.

<pre>

Request to Test IPv6 Name Resolution
=====================================
The IPv6 for e-Business Project (see  http://www.ipv6.org.au) is calling for volunteers to help with
testing the name resolution of an IPv6 website.  The www.ipv6.org.au site has the following IP addresses:

IPv4:   www.ipv6.org.au   A       203.42.34.45
IPv6:   www.ipv6.org.au   AAAA    2001:388:f000::7db

The Project committee is asking anyone with IPv6 connectivity (either native or via tunnels) to try to
resolve the IPv6-enabled website via the AAAA record supplied above, This simply means going to the
website, http://www.ipv6.org.au and see if you get the IPv4 or the IPv6 version.

Whether you are successful or not, please fill out the details below and email the results to Holly
Raiche, Executive Director of ISOC-AU, at ed@isoc-au.org.au, or ring 0412 688 544 to discuss.

Step 1
======

Before attempting to resolve the ipv6.org.au website please make sure you have IPv6 connectivity and
that your web browser supports IPv6 resolution (the latest versions should).

Then test you have IPv6 transit by using 'ping6':
* For Windows systems use "ping6 2001:388:f000::7db" from the windows command line (please also see
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/cg0305.mspx )

* For Unix/Linux flavors use "ping6 2001:388:f000::7db" from the command line (please also see
  http://www.linux.com/howtos/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/x830.shtml#PROGRAM-PING6 )

* For Macs it is possible to use the Unix/Linux command (above) or you may use the Network Utility.app
  located in the Application/Utilities folder, which has a ping GUI.

Step 2
======
If you are sure you have IPv6 connectivity, then in your browser go to the website,
http://www.ipv6.org.au and see if the IPv4 version or the IPv6 version appears (they have a
different welcome message).

IF only the IPv4 version appears, try to see if you can reach the IPv6 one by going to
http://[2001:388:f000::7db] (with [ ] as shown).

Step 3
=======
WHATEVER happens, please tell us:
1) Your Operating System: e.g. Windows (XP, Vista), Unix (flavour), Linux (flavour), Mac (OS version), etc.
2) Your Web Browser and its version number: e.g. Internet Explorer (6 or 7), Firefox (1 or 2), the
Mozilla suite (includes Safari, Konqueror,
    Gecko, Netscape), Opera, etc.
3) Were you able to ping the IPv6 address?
4) Could you reach the IPv6 website by using the domain name?
5) Could you reach the IPv6 website by using the IP address?
6) Did you have any problems with your connection, delays in resolving, or the website, etc?
7) Other comments you may wish to add?

Thank you very much for your help!

<h3>4.4 IETF Standards Documents Relating to Underpinning Infrastructure </a></h3>

Before IPv6 can be widely deployed to reach its full potential, it must be
widely understood and accepted as an important step forward for the Internet.
The <a href="http://www.ietf.org">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> created
and defined all of the standards for IPv6 since work on the next-generation
version began in the early/mid-1990s. Some issues have been easily resolved,
but as more experience is gained with IPv6-enabled systems and networks, some
areas require re-examination and further discussion.

Below are the IETF standards documents relating to some current issues in IPv6.
