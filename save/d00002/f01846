<p> <b> There is no guarantee you will not lose your data when trying
  to play with the device. <b>Think backup!</b>. I have already lost
  my device (locked on the second flashing point at reboot).</b> </p>

<p> In November 2009, I ordered a Nokia N900. After playing with the
  N770 (more a prototype than anything else), I bought its successor,
  the N810, 2 years ago. Now the latest version, the N900, comes with
  everything needed: big screen 800x480), GSM/3G, fast processor,
  hardware graphic acceleration, lot of storage, real keyboard, a good
  user interface and many other elements. And of course, like the
  previous versions ... it runs Linux.</p>

<p> The main goal in buying the N900 was to make it run Mobile IPv6
  using <a href="http://umip.org/">UMIP</a> (the device comes with a
  2.6.28 kernel so it is just a matter of enabling some kernel
  options) and then test
  the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ebalard-mext-ipsec-ro-01">IPsec
  Route Optimization</a> extensions I specified on a real
  platform. This is a work in progress. </p>

<h2> <a href="n900-commented-hardware-specs.html"> N900 commented
    hardware specifications </a> </h2>

<p> I started working on a <a href="n900-commented-hardware-specs.html">dedicated
  page</a>, commenting hardware specifications and providing
  additional information on how the hardware is supported by the
  kernel, free and proprietary userland software.</p>

<p> Basically, if you ask yourself something about a specific hardware
  part of the device, you may find an answer on that page. This is a
  work in progress: it is updated each time I learn anything new on
  the hardware.</p>

<h2> Building/porting applications for the N900 </h2>

<p> As they were not available in external repositories, I started
  porting applications that I find useful. I wrote dedicated pages
  for the records for those interested: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="n900-apps-emacs-22.2.html">Emacs 22.2 for the N900</a></li>
<li><a href="n900-apps-emacs-23.1.93.html">Emacs
    23.1.93 for the N900</a> <font color="green">[A]</font></li>
<li><a href="n900-apps-umip.html">UMIP (Linux Mobile IPv6 Daemon) for
    the N900</a> <font color="green">[A]</font></li>
<li> Racoon (IKEv1 Daemon) for the N900 <font color="green">[A]</font></li>
</ul>

<p> Those marked as available <font color="green">[A]</font> can be
  installed from <a href="../debian-n900/">my N900 repository</a>. You
  can either open <a href="../debian-n900/natisbad.org.install">this
  link</a> or add the repository manually (Application manager &gt;
  Application catalogs &gt; New ) using following parameters </p>

<ul>
<li> Name: <b> natisbad.org </b> </li>
<li> Web Address: <b> http://natisbad.org/debian-n900</b> </li>
<li> Distribution: <b> fremantle </b> </li>
<li> Components: <b> main </b> </li>
</ul>

<p> If you want to pass it to <b>apt-key</b>, the repository key
  is <a href="../debian-n900/n900-debian-repo.key">here</a> with its
  <a href="../debian-n900/n900-debian-repo.key.sig">signature</a>: </p> 

<pre>
n900# wget -q http://natisbad.org/debian-n900/n900-debian-repo.key
n900# wget -q http://natisbad.org/debian-n900/n900-debian-repo.key.sig
n900# gpg --verify n900-debian-repo.key.sig
gpg: Signature made Wed 03 Mar 2010 10:57:03 AM CET using RSA key ID A7AE341B
gpg: Good signature from "Arnaud Ebalard &lt;arno@natisbad.org&gt;"
n900# apt-key add n900-debian-repo.key
OK
</pre>

<p> I know I should probably take the time to push the packages to
  extras-devel. This is on a long todo list. </p>

<h2><a href="n900-custom-kernel.html"> Building a custom kernel for your N900 </a></h2>

<p> As discussed above, the kernel that comes on the device is a
  2.6.28. This means it comes with everything needed to support MIPv6
  with IPsec and IKE ... but the required options are not enabled in
  the image provided by Nokia. For that reason (you may have
  different), I need a custom image.</p>

<p> In order to do that, after having installed the SDK, this can be
  achieved quite easily. I have written a short page describing
  everything in details. It is
  available <a href="n900-custom-kernel.html">here</a>. </p> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a href="n900-current-linux-omap-kernel.html"> Current linux-omap kernel on Nokia N900? </a></h2>

<p> I started looking at what is needed to get current linux-omap
  kernel running on Nokia N900. This is
  discussed <a href="n900-current-linux-omap-kernel.html">here</a>. </p>

<h2><a href="n900-tips-and-tricks.html"> N900 Tips and Tricks </a></h2>

<p> I have a started a dedicated pages to put everything regarding the
  N900 that does not belong to other specific pages. If you are
  looking for additional general information on the day-to-day use of
  the device, it is
  available <a href="n900-tips-and-tricks.html">here</a>.</p>
