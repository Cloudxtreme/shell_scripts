In this dissertation, architecture and protocols are studied and
advocated for the universal mobile Internet.  As mobile entities will
become an integral part of the Internet in terms of their number, the
current Internet architecture needs to be evolved. According to the
proposed principles of the mobile Internet architecture, the current
mobility technology such as Mobile IPv6 and the Basic NEMO protocol
lack features of always-on connectivity, optimal routing,
architectural robustness and scalability. The universal mobile
architecture is an architecture which fulfills all the features 
proposed in the principle of mobile Internet architecture. 
<p>
The universal mobile Internet architecture is designed for all IP
wireless communication infrastructure with the concept of {\it Smart
End, Intelligent Edge, and Simple Robust Backbone}. Each mobile node
obtains intelligence to adapt to visiting network dynamically with
help of edge network. Edge network that contains access routers and
wireless systems such as GSM, GPRS, W-CDMA, etc provides fast handover
processing and wireless connectivity. Backbone network are kept simple
to accommodate a large number of mobile nodes.  Along with the
concept, three new solutions: (1) multi-access, (2)virtual mobility
control domain, and (3) ad-hoc managements, are proposed for the
universal mobile Internet. As a result, the universal mobile Internet
is realized supporting always-on connectivity, optimal routing,
architectural robustness and scalability.
<p>
The multi-access support provides always-on Internet connectivity and
efficient communication scheme.  A mobile node has various network
interfaces and accesses to the Internet by selecting available
interfaces depending on visiting networks. However, the current
mobility protocols prohibit activating multiple connectivity
simultaneously. With our proposal, the mobile node acquires care-of
addresses on all the available interfaces and registers them to its
home agent and correspondent nodes as the bindings of the same home
address. The mobile node, then, sends and receives particular flows at
the most appropriate interface depending on local policy. The
evaluations show the multi-access solution improves communication
performance and provides durable Internet connectivity.
<p>
The virtual mobility control domain provides architectural robustness
and optimal communication that are underlying principles of the mobile
Internet architecture. The existing mobility protocols rely on single
anchor point called home agent. The single home agent causes fatal
performance decline due to overload of packet processing and system
failure for mobile nodes; this is called single point of failure.
Furthermore, the general Internet routing mechanism imposes redundant
routes between end mobile nodes due to the dogleg routing.  The
proposed virtual mobility control domain enables mobility protocols to
place multiple anchor points anywhere on the Internet despite the
topology relationship. It consists of two new protocols, they are, the
inter home agents protocol and the optimized route cache protocol. The
inter home agents protocol activates multiple home agents for a same
mobile node simultaneously. In the protocol, registered binding is
implicitly synchronized among home agents without having mobile nodes
aware of it.  Alternatively, the optimized route cache protocol is
introduced to activate an anchor point called correspondent router
on-demand. The mobile node dynamically discovers a correspondent
router and explicitly registers its binding. The correspondent router,
then, acts as an anchor point on behalf of the home agent. The virtual
mobility control domain is proved to provide robustness of mobility
protocols and optimal communication with anchor points distribution in
our evaluation. It can be concluded that the general Internet routing
mechanism needs to interact with the virtual mobility control domain
in terms of the best anchor point selection for optimal routing on the
universal mobile Internet.
<p>
The ad-hoc managements are exclusive features of the universal mobile
Internet architecture. They are Internet connectivity and direct
connectivity establishments by using mobile ad-hoc network (MANET)
routing protocol.  When a mobile node loses connectivity to the
Internet, it dynamically discovers an adjacent Internet Gateway that
provides Internet connectivity for mobile ad-hoc networks.  After IPv6
global address resolution and route setup for the Internet Gateway,
the mobile node accesses the Internet via the Internet Gateway on
multihop wireless networks. Meanwhile, the Internet Gateways support
the Basic NEMO protocol, it will possibly have two routes for a
destination. One of them will be a route via home agent and the
Internet, called the NEMO route, and the other is a direct route
through intermediate nodes within MANET, called a MANET route.  When a
mobile node moves closely to a destination node, it locally discovers
MANET routes and communicates without using the Internet infrastructure. The
mobile node needs to select MANET routes only while the routes are
shorter and faster than NEMO routes.  Simulation work confirms better
performance with MANET routes than NEMO routes in terms of round trip
time.
<p>
As a result, this dissertation contributes to design the universal
mobile Internet architecture supporting scalability, robustness and
performance improvements. The mobile Internet architecture encompasses
diversity of mobile environments and keeps consistency with the
existing Internet. This universal mobile Internet will be a common
infrastructure of mobile computing and pioneers mobile industry.
