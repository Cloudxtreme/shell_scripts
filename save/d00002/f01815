      <strong><a name="Organization"></a>A. ICANN, the organization</strong><br>
      <br>
      The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit, 
      private-sector corporation that serves as a major technical coordination 
      body for the Internet. Created in 1998 by a broad coalition of the Internet’s 
      business, technical, academic, and user communities, ICANN has been gradually 
      assuming the responsibility for a set of technical functions previously 
      performed under U. S. government contract by the Internet Assigned Numbers 
      Authority (IANA) and other groups. ICANN is a California public benefit, 
      non-profit corporation.<br>
      <br>
      ICANN’s mission is "to coordinate, at the overall level, the global Internet’s 
      systems of unique identifiers, and in particular to ensure the stable and 
      secure operation of the Internet’s unique identifier systems. In particular, 
      ICANN: 
      <ol>
        <li>Coordinates the allocation and assignment of the three sets of unique 
          identifiers for the Internet, which are: 
          <ul>
            <li>Domain names (forming a system referred to as "DNS");</li>
            <li>Internet protocol ("IP") addresses and autonomous system ("AS") 
              numbers; and</li>
            <li>Protocol port and parameter numbers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Coordinates the operation and evolution of the DNS root name server 
          system.</li>
        <li>Coordinates policy development reasonably and appropriately related 
          to these technical functions." &lt;<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I">http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I</a>&gt; 
        </li>
      </ol>
	  ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of the Internet; 
      to promoting competition; to achieving broad representation of global Internet 
      communities; and to developing policy appropriate to its mission through 
      bottom-up consensus-based processes. <br>

      Important Opportunities to Contribute to this Global Enterprise</strong> 
      <br>
      <br>
      The ICANN Nominating Committee (NomCom) invites the participation of the 
      Internet community in its ongoing process for selection of well-qualified, 
      accomplished individuals to serve in four sets of leadership positions within 
      ICANN. The following seats are to be filled in the 2004 NomCom process: 
	  <blockquote> Board of Directors (3 seats) <br>
        Generic Names Supporting Organization Council (1 seat)<br>
        Interim At-Large Advisory Council (2 seats) <br>
        Country Code Names Supporting Organization Council (3 seats)<br>
        <br>
      </blockquote>
		
      <div align="center"><img src="icann-structure.gif"><br>
      </div>
        
      <br>
      Those selected by NomCom will work with accomplished colleagues from around 
      the globe to address intriguing technical coordination problems and related 
      policy development challenges with diverse functional, cultural, and geographic 
      dimensions. <br>
      <br>
      They will make an important public service contribution and gain useful 
      experience and perspective. Placing the broad public interest ahead of any 
      particular interests, they will help ensure the stability and security of 
      this valuable global resource for critically important societal functions.<br>
      <br>
      ICANN holds meetings approximately 3 times a year in locations around the 
      world. These meetings constitute an essential part of ICANN's global consensus-development 
      and outreach efforts. Note that much of the work of the ICANN Board, GNSO 
      Council, Interim ALAC, and ccNSO Council is done via e-mail and teleconference. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Those who hold these positions serve without compensation but can receive 
      travel expense reimbursement where authorized and where resources have been 
      allocated within the ICANN budget. (Funds to reimburse travel expenses of 
      all NomCom Selected Nominees have been requested in the ICANN budget for 
      FY05.)<br>
      <br>
      The whole Internet community benefits from the volunteered effort of the 
      many individuals who serve in the organization. ICANN respects and appreciates 
      this generous contribution of time, energy and effort.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>We invite both (1) Recommendations of persons who should be considered 
      for these positions and (2) Statements of Interest from persons wishing 
      to be considered for them. <br>
      <br>
      For full consideration Recommendations should be submitted promptly and 
      Statements of Interest should be received no later than 12:00 GMT 25 August, 2004 </strong><br>
        <br>
      <strong><a name="HighQualificationsSoughtintheNomComProcess"></a>C. High 
      Qualifications Sought in the NomCom Process</strong><br>
      <br>
      NomCom seeks women and men who have demonstrated the maturity, experience, 
      knowledge, and skills to handle the tasks and make the judgments involved 
      in fulfilling these important leadership roles. <br>
      <br>
      NomCom seeks persons of the highest integrity and capability with experience 
      and talents for problem-solving, policy development, and decision-making 
      involving diverse perspectives regarding how best to accomplish the mission 
      and responsibilities of ICANN. Those selected in the NomCom process will 
      also be expected to place the public interest of the global Internet ahead 
      of any particular interests. <br>
      <br>
      In NomCom’s selections, such qualifications are more significant than is 
      deep involvement in technical aspects of the Internet. The NomCom Selected 
      Nominees are expected to be knowledgeable, or committed to becoming knowledgeable, 
      about the environment in which ICANN operates and the technical functions 
      for which it is responsible, but strong technical knowledge of the Internet 
      is not the determining factor in the NomCom selections.<br>
      <br>
      ICANN also has complementary selection processes, based in the Supporting 
      Organizations and Advisory Committees, which are designed to ensure that 
      the needed technical expertise and knowledge of constituencies is present 
      in the ICANN leadership bodies. Together, NomCom and these complementary 
      selection processes yield, in the aggregate, the full range of skills and 
      experience needed for the organization.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom will apply the criteria and terms of eligibility defined in the ICANN 
      Bylaws to develop a pool of qualified candidates (See Section D). In selecting 
      from this candidate pool, NomCom will also take into account additional 
      considerations related to the specific roles to be filled and will support 
      implementation of <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I-2">ICANN’s 
      Core Values</a>, including its commitment to seek and support broad functional, 
      geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at all levels of policy 
      development and decision-making. NomCom recognizes that the term cultural 
      diversity is multifaceted, including gender, ethnic, religious, and other 
      forms of diversity. <br>
      <br>
      NomCom encourages wide participation in this process, and will be grateful 
      for the valuable input it hopes to receive. <br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="TimingCriteriaandCoreValues"></a>D. Timing, Criteria and 
      Core Values for Positions to be Filled by NomCom</strong><br>
      <br>
      By 1 November 2004, the NomCom expects to make its final selections for 
      individuals to serve the Terms of Duty that are associated with the following 
      positions:  
	  <ul>
	  	<li>ICANN Board of Directors (3 seats, 3 year terms)</li>
	    <li>Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) Council Members (1 seat, 2 year term)</li>
		<li>Interim At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) Members (2 seats, 2 year terms)</li>
		<li>Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) Council Members (3 seats,  one 1 year term, one 2 year term, and one 3 year term)</li>
	  </ul>
       As provided in the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm">ICANN 
      Bylaws</a>, the starting date for terms of duty for these positions is the 
      end of ICANN's 2004 Annual Meeting (to be held from 1-5 December 2004 in 
      Cape Town, South Africa). The ending date is the conclusion of a specific 
      later ICANN Annual Meeting, depending on the length of term applicable. 
      <br>
      <br>
      NomCom will use the Criteria for Selection of ICANN Directors contained 
      in the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-3">ICANN Bylaws</a> 
      for <strong><em>all</em></strong> four sets of positions it will fill. These 
      Criteria are: 
      <ol>
	  	<li>"Accomplished persons of integrity, objectivity, and intelligence, with reputations for sound judgment and open minds, and a demonstrated capacity for thoughtful group decision-making;</li>
	    <li>Persons with an understanding of ICANN's mission and the potential impact of ICANN decisions on the global Internet community, and committed to the success of ICANN;</li>
	    <li>Persons who will produce the broadest cultural and geographic diversity 
          on the Board consistent with meeting the other criteria set forth in 
          this Section;</li>
	    <li>Persons who, in the aggregate, have personal familiarity with the operation of gTLD registries and registrars; with ccTLD registries; with IP address registries; with Internet technical standards and protocols; with policy-development procedures, legal traditions, and the public interest; and with the broad range of business, individual, academic, and non-commercial users of the Internet;</li>
	    <li>Persons who are willing to serve as volunteers, without compensation other than the reimbursement of certain expenses; and </li>
	    <li>Persons who are able to work and communicate in written and spoken English."</li>
	  </ol>
	  Note that NomCom welcomes and encourages participation from all members 
      of the global Internet community. Although Candidates should be able to 
      both work and communicate well in English, there is no requirement that 
      English be the candidate's first language. <br>
      <br>
      In making its selections, NomCom will look for persons who can help implement 
      ICANN’s <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I-2">Core Values</a>, 
      stated in its Bylaws:<br>
      <br>
      "In performing its mission, the following core values should guide the decisions 
      and actions of ICANN:  
	  <ol>
	  	<li>Preserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet.</li>
	    <li>Respecting the creativity, innovation, and flow of information made possible by the Internet by limiting ICANN's activities to those matters within ICANN's mission requiring or significantly benefiting from global coordination.</li>
	    <li>To the extent feasible and appropriate, delegating coordination functions to or recognizing the policy role of other responsible entities that reflect the interests of affected parties.</li>
	    <li>Seeking and supporting broad, informed participation reflecting the functional, geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at all levels of policy development and decision-making.</li>
	    <li>Where feasible and appropriate, depending on market mechanisms to promote and sustain a competitive environment.</li>
	    <li>Introducing and promoting competition in the registration of domain names where practicable and beneficial in the public interest.</li>
	    <li>Employing open and transparent policy development mechanisms that (i) promote well-informed decisions based on expert advice, and (ii) ensure that those entities most affected can assist in the policy development process.</li>
	    <li>Making decisions by applying documented policies neutrally and objectively, with integrity and fairness.</li>
	    <li>Acting with a speed that is responsive to the needs of the Internet while, as part of the decision-making process, obtaining informed input from those entities most affected.</li>
	    <li>Remaining accountable to the Internet community through mechanisms that enhance ICANN's effectiveness.</li>
	    <li>While remaining rooted in the private sector, recognizing that governments and public authorities are responsible for public policy and duly taking into account governments' or public authorities' recommendations. </li>
	  </ol>
	  These core values are deliberately expressed in very general terms, so that 
      they may provide useful and relevant guidance in the broadest possible range 
      of circumstances. Because they are not narrowly prescriptive, the specific 
      way in which they apply, individually and collectively, to each new situation 
      will necessarily depend on many factors that cannot be fully anticipated 
      or enumerated; and because they are statements of principle rather than 
      practice, situations will inevitably arise in which perfect fidelity to 
      all eleven core values simultaneously is not possible. Any ICANN body making 
      a recommendation or decision shall exercise its judgment to determine which 
      core values are most relevant and how they apply to the specific circumstances 
      of the case at hand, and to determine, if necessary, an appropriate and 
      defensible balance among competing values." <br>

      ICANN’s Directors, as a group, are responsible for exercising the powers 
      of ICANN, controlling its property, and conducting or directing its business 
      and affairs, except as otherwise provided in the ICANN Articles of Incorporation 
      or Bylaws. Directors serve as individuals who have the duty to act in what 
      they reasonably believe are the best interests of ICANN and not as representatives 
      of the entity that selected them, their employers, or any other organizations 
      or constituencies. Directors are expected to support the ICANN mission and 
      the implementation of ICANN’s <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I-2">Core 
      Values</a>. <br>
      <br>
      NomCom will use the Selection Criteria for Directors, set forth in the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-3">Bylaws</a>, 
      for these positions.<br>
      <br>
      ICANN Directors shall receive no compensation for their services as Directors. 
      The Board may, however, authorize the reimbursement of actual and necessary 
      reasonable expenses incurred by Directors performing their duties as Directors. 
      [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-22">Bylaws Article 
      VI, Section 22</a>]<br>
      <br>
      <em>Board Eligibility Factors</em> 
      <ol>
	  	<li>No person who serves on the NomCom in any capacity is eligible for 
          selection by any means to any position on the Board or any other ICANN 
          body having one or more membership positions that the Nominating Committee 
          is responsible for filling, until the conclusion of an ICANN annual 
          meeting that coincides with, or is after, the conclusion of that person's 
          service on the Nominating Committee. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-8">Bylaws, 
          Article VII, Section 8</a>] </li>
	    <li>NomCom shall seek to ensure that the ICANN Board is composed of members 
          who in the aggregate display diversity in geography, culture, skills, 
          experience, and perspective, by applying the criteria set forth above 
          in this document. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-2">Bylaws, 
          Article VI, Section 2(2)</a>]</li>
		 
        <li>At no time shall the NomCom select a Director to fill any vacancy 
          or expired term whose selection would cause the total number of Directors 
          (not including the President) who are citizens of countries in any one 
          Geographic Region to exceed five; and the NomCom shall ensure through 
          its selections that at all times the Board includes at least one Director 
          who is a citizen of a country in each ICANN Geographic Region. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-2">Bylaws, 
          Article VI, Section 2(2)</a>]</li>
	     
        <li>No official of a national government or a multinational entity established 
          by treaty or other agreement between national governments may serve 
          as a Director. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-4">Bylaws, 
          Article VI, Section 4(1)</a>]</li>
	     
        <li>No person who serves in any capacity (including as a liaison) on any 
          Supporting Organization Council shall simultaneously serve as a Director 
          or liaison to the Board. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-4">Bylaws, 
          Article VI, Section 4(2)</a>]</li>
	     
        <li>All current ICANN Directors whose terms are expiring and all past 
          Directors except Pindar Wong and Linda Wilson, are eligible for selection 
          in 2004, since none of them has exceeded the three term limit as defined 
          in the Bylaws. Wong and Wilson are ineligible in 2004 by reason of their 
          service on the NomCom. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VI-8">Bylaws 
          Article VI, Section 8(5)</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-8">Article

      <br>
      <em>Time Commitment</em> <br>
      <br>
      The basic responsibilities of an ICANN Director require a commitment of 
      time roughly equivalent to a full day every two weeks, exclusive of any 
      work on Board Committees. The time spent in these basic responsibilities 
      is typically clustered around Board meetings and teleconferences.<br>
      <br>
      Directors spend additional time in connection with their work on Board Committees, 
      a commitment that varies in relation to the number of Committees on which 
      they serve, the scope of the Committee's responsibilities, and their role 
      as Chair or Member of the Committee.<br>

      The <a href="http://gnso.icann.org/">Generic Names Supporting Organization</a> 
      (GNSO) is a policy-development body responsible for developing and recommending 
      to the ICANN Board substantive policies relating to generic top-level domains. 
      The GNSO consists of various Constituencies representing particular groups 
      of stakeholders and a GNSO Council, responsible for managing the policy 
      development process of the GNSO. The GNSO Constituencies choose some of 
      the Council members; NomCom chooses three Council members with staggered 
      terms.<br>
      <br>
      GNSO Council Members receive no compensation for their services as GNSO 
      Council Members. ICANN provides administrative and operational support necessary 
      for the GNSO to carry out its responsibilities. Such support shall not include 
      an obligation for ICANN to fund travel expenses incurred by GNSO participants 
      for travel to any meeting of the GNSO or for any other purpose. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#X-4">Bylaws 
      Article X, Section 4</a>]<br>
      <br>
      NomCom will use the Criteria for Selection of ICANN Directors (see above) 
      in choosing Selected Nominees for the GNSO Council. GNSO Council members 
      are expected to support the ICANN mission and the implementation of ICANN’s 
      <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#I-2">Core Values</a>.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom will also take into account the following eligibility factors and 
      additional considerations.<br>
      <br>
      <em>GNSO Council Eligibility Factors</em> 
      <ol>
	  	<li>No person who serves on the NomCom in any capacity is eligible for 
          selection by any means to any position on the Board or any other ICANN 
          body having one or more membership positions that the Nominating Committee 
          is responsible for filling, until the conclusion of an ICANN annual 
          meeting that coincides with, or is after, the conclusion of that person's 
          service on the Nominating Committee. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-8">Bylaws, 
          Article VII, Section 8</a>] </li>
	    <li>No more than one officer, director, or employee of any particular 
          corporation or other organization (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) 
          shall serve on the GNSO Council at any given time. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#X-3.5">Bylaws, 
          Article X, Section 3(5)</a>]</li>
	  </ol>
	  <em>Additional Considerations</em> <br>
      <br>
      For the GNSO Council position, specific experience related to the scope 
      of the GNSO’s work with the Domain Name System would be advantageous. <br>
      <br>
      The current composition of the GNSO Council is available <a href="http://gnso.icann.org/council/members.shtml">here</a>. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The Bylaws do not state a limit on the number of terms GNSO Council members 
      may serve.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Time Commitment</em><br>
      <br>
      An average GNSO Council member would spend at least 12 hours per month on 
      Council related activities, with those chairing committees or task forces 
      spending at least 50 hours a month. (The commitment involves a minimum of 
      6 hours per month based on an average of 1.5 two-hour teleconferences (or 
      physical meetings) per month plus about two hours of preparation for each 
      meeting for reading task force reports and potentially discussing with the 
      community. Participation in committees of the council and/or task forces 
      could easily double that minimum time commitment.)<br>

      The role of the <a href="http://alac.icann.org/">At-Large Advisory Committee</a> 
      (ALAC) is to consider and provide advice on the activities of ICANN, insofar 
      as they relate to the interests of individual Internet users. Upon the seating 
      of persons selected by all five Regional At Large Organizations (RALOs), 
      the Interim At-Large Advisory Committee shall become the At-Large Advisory 
      Committee, as established by <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XI-2.4">Article 
      XI, Section 2(4)</a> of the New Bylaws. The individuals selected to the 
      Interim At-Large Advisory Committee by the Nominating Committee shall become 
      members of the At-Large Advisory Committee for the remainder of the terms 
      for which they were selected. Some members of the Interim ALAC are chosen 
      by each of the RALOs (or by the ICANN Board subject to the <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XX-7">Transition 
      Article</a> of the Bylaws); NomCom chooses five members with staggered terms.<br>
      <br>
      Interim ALAC Committee members, like the members of ICANN's other Advisory 
      Committees, receive no compensation for their services as a member of a 
      committee. The Board may, however, authorize the reimbursement of the actual 
      and necessary expenses incurred by Advisory Committee members performing 
      their duties as Advisory Committee members. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XI-6">Bylaws

	    <li>The five members of ALAC selected by the NomCom shall include one 
          citizen of a country within each of the five Geographic Regions (Europe; 
          Asia/Australia/Pacific; Latin America/Caribbean Islands; Africa; and

          Article VI, Section 5</a>.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <em>Additional Considerations</em> <br>
      <br>
      For the ALAC positions, experience and skills that bear on gathering, understanding, 
      and communicating the interests of individual users would be advantageous. 
      Perspectives not otherwise reflected in the existing ALAC membership would 
      be advantageous. NomCom’s selections for ALAC are intended to diversify 
      the skill and experience sets of the ALAC, including in such areas as group 
      decision-making. <br>

      may serve.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Time Commitment</em><br>
      <br>
      Approximately 7 hours per week is required of members of Interim ALAC to 
      fulfill their duties in this role. This includes participating in online 
      (e-mail) discussions, commenting on/contributing to documents/proposed actions

      The <a href="http://ccnso.icann.org/">Country Code Names Supporting Organization</a> 
      is a policy-development body which is responsible for developing and recommending 
      to the Board global policies relating to country-code top-level domains 
      (ccTLDs), nurturing consensus across the ccNSO's community, including the 
      name-related activities of ccTLDs; and coordinating with other ICANN Supporting 
      Organizations, committees, and constituencies under ICANN. <br>
      <br>
      In addition to the above core responsibilities, the ccNSO may also engage 
      in other activities authorized by its members, including: seeking to develop 
      voluntary best practices for ccTLD managers, assisting in skills building 
      within the global community of ccTLD managers, and enhancing operational 
      and technical cooperation among ccTLD managers. The ccNSO consists of ccTLD 
      managers that have agreed in writing to be members of the ccNSO, and a ccNSO 
      Council responsible for managing the policy-development process of the ccNSO. 
      Some ccNSO Council members are chosen by the ccNSO members within each of 
      ICANN's Geographic Regions; NomCom chooses three members with staggered 
      terms.<br>
      <br>
      ccNSO Council members receive no compensation for their services as ccNSO 
      Council Members. Upon request of the ccNSO Council, ICANN shall provide 
      administrative and operational support necessary for the ccNSO to carry 
      out its responsibilities. Such support shall not include an obligation for 
      ICANN to fund travel expenses incurred by ccNSO participants for travel 
      to any meeting of the ccNSO or for any other purpose. The ccNSO Council 
      may make provision, at ccNSO expense, for administrative and operational 
      support in addition or as an alternative to support provided by ICANN. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#IX-7">Bylaws

	  <em>Additional Considerations</em> <br>
      <br>
      For the ccNSO Council positions, while no specific considerations are reflected 
      in the Bylaws, experience or knowledge of ccTLDs and issues of importance 
      to the global Internet, would be advantageous. Additionally, familiarity 
      with the global environment in which ICANN operates and perspectives not 
      otherwise reflected in the ccTLD community would be advantageous. Experience 
      in international organizations and in developing new organizations is likewise 
      valuable for these positions.<br>

      You may apply for any of the available positions set out in the Statement 
      of Interest for which you are eligible and in which you would be willing 
      to serve. You may apply for up to four positions; however, you are encouraged 
      to read and consider carefully the background materials on each position 
      prior to filling out the Statement of Interest form below.<br>
      <br>
      The NomCom may contact you later if it would like to consider you for a 
      position which you have not marked, but NomCom is working on a very tight

      <br>
      <em> Liability/Indemnification</em><br>
      <br>
      ICANN Directors, GNSO Council members, Interim ALAC members and ccNSO Council 
      members enjoy several types of protection from liability for their activities 
      in service to ICANN. These may be summarized as follows:<br>
      <br>
      (a) Indemnification by ICANN. Under its bylaws, ICANN indemnifies members 
      of ICANN bodies against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other 
      amounts that actually and reasonably arise in a proceeding because those 
      persons are acting or have acted as agents of ICANN. There are various conditions 
      to this indemnity, including that the indemnified person’s acts were in 
      good faith and done in a manner reasonably believed to be in ICANN’s best 
      interests and not criminal. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#XIV">Bylaws 
      Article XIV</a>]<br>
      <br>
      (b) Insurance. ICANN carries insurance covering liabilities (including defense 
      expenses) that ICANN and its Directors, volunteers, and committee members 
      may incur by reason of acts or omissions solely in their capacities as Directors, 
      volunteers, and committee members acting on behalf of ICANN. The insurance 
      policy includes deductibles, exclusions, and conditions that are ordinary 
      in a liability policy covering directors, officers, and volunteers of a 
      non-profit corporation.<br>
      <br>
      (c) Statutory Immunity. United States federal law and California law contain 
      provisions shielding volunteers to non-profit organizations (such as ICANN) 
      from liabilities for their volunteer work, with some conditions. The U.S. 
      Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 protects volunteers (i.e. those serving 
      without compensation) to non-profit organizations from liability for harm 
      caused by their acts and omissions while acting within the scope of their 
      responsibilities in the organization and not in a willful, criminal, grossly 
      negligent, reckless, etc. manner. [<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/42/chapters/139/toc.html">42 
      United States Code &sect;&sect;14501-14505</a>] California law provides 
      similar liability protections to volunteer directors. [<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/corp/5230-5239.html">California 
      Corporations Code &sect; 5239</a>]<br>
      <br>
      Although there are various conditions and limits on each type of protection, 
      in the aggregate these protections provide significant protection to ICANN 
      volunteers acting in good faith and in the scope of their responsibilities 
      to ICANN.<br>

	  <em>NomCom Process </em><br>
      <br>
      Central to the Nominating Committee’s process are the Statements of Interest 
      received from individuals who agree to be considered for service in any 
      of the positions. A person who has submitted a complete Statement of Interest 
      is considered a Candidate for selection by the NomCom. NomCom will begin 
      its review of Candidate information contained in the completed Statement 
      of Interest as soon as it is received and confirmed to have all the required 
      information. If the Statement of Interest is missing required information, 
      the individual will not be considered a Candidate for selection by the NomCom.<br>
      <br>
      The NomCom will evaluate Candidates in a fair and consistent manner, considering 
      the Statement of Interest, references, interviews as needed, consultations, 
      and third-party information sources. While doing so, it will adhere to its 
      <a href="/ethics-2004.html">Code 
      of Ethics</a>, which includes procedures regarding Confidentiality and Conflicts 
      of Interest. <br>
      <br>
      To ensure open and frank communication with the NomCom, we have paid particular 
      attention in our procedures to safeguarding confidentiality. Specifically, 
      under our procedures all NomCom members will safeguard all internal NomCom 
      communications and treat them as strictly private, confidential, and for 
      the use of the immediate committee members and NomCom staff only, without 
      exception.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom members will not disclose outside of the committee the identities 
      of Candidates under consideration by the NomCom, nor any discussions about 
      them, unless both the Candidate and the NomCom as a whole have given explicit 
      authorization to disclose the information. Nor will NomCom disclose the 
      identity of those who recommend candidates or whether a specific candidate 
      has been recommended.<br>
      <br>
      Note that because NomCom will need to check references and consult selected 
      third-party sources on a confidential basis before making its final selections, 
      those wishing to be considered as Candidates are required to confirm this 
      understanding of the confidentiality arrangements when they submit a Statement 
      of Interest. <br>
      <br>
      When NomCom has completed its selections, it will publish the identities 
      of the Selected Nominees. Statistical information, such as the size and 
      nature of the candidate pool, will be published at the close of the process. 
      No other personally identifiable information will be publicized or retained 
      after the selection process has been completed.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that this Nominating Committee process differs from an 
      election, although the goal is the same: to elicit the Internet community’s 
      participation in a thoughtful process leading to the selection of very well-qualified 
      individuals to fulfill the specific roles of their positions.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom’s selections are final; no further approval or ratification will 
      take place.<br>
      <br>
      While considerable care has been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness 
      of this Formal Call, the NomCom reserves the right to make additions and 
      corrections. If any <!-- #BeginDate format:Sw1 -->19 February, 2009<!-- #EndDate -->

      <em>NomCom Background</em><br>
      <br>
      NomCom operates independently from the ICANN Board, the Supporting Organizations 
      and Advisory Committees. The functional and geographic diversity and independence 
      of NomCom members enables and encourages it to select persons who are not 
      beholden to any particular interests and are capable of representing the 
      broader view of the Internet community.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet 
      community and within the scope of the ICANN Mission and the responsibilities 
      assigned to NomCom by the ICANN Bylaws.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom seeks widespread participation, through submission of Recommendations 
      and Statements of Interest, to find the talent and experience needed for 
      these roles, to inform NomCom’s decisions, and to generate the confidence 
      and respect of the community for those whom NomCom selects. <br>
      <br>
      Further information about NomCom’s origin, role, responsibilities, procedures, 
      composition, and biographical information about its members have been placed 
      on the <a href="http://www.icann.org/">NomCom webpage</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="HowtoSubmitaRecommendation"></a>H. How to Submit a Recommendation</strong><br>
      <br>
      To enhance the Candidate pool from which NomCom will choose Selected Nominees, 
      we encourage you to submit recommendations of individuals whom we should 
      invite to complete the Statement of Interest. <br>
      <br>
      To submit a Recommendation, please send an e-mail to &lt;<a href="mailto:nomcom-submissions@icann.org">nomcom-submissions@icann.org</a>&gt; 
      that includes the following information: 
      <blockquote> (a) Name of Recommendee <br>
        (b) Recommendee’s e-mail address<br>
        (c) Your name<br>
        (d) Your e-mail address </blockquote>
      NomCom will acknowledge your recommendation and will provide your recommendee(s) 
      the Statement of Interest Form and Instructions. We ask you to inform those 
      whom you recommend that you have submitted their names to NomCom. <br>
      <br>
      Early submission of Recommendations will be appreciated. <br>
      <br>
      Recommendations should be received by NomCom no later than 12:00 GMT 20th 
      August 2004. NomCom reserves the right to consider Recommendations received 
      after 12:00 GMT 20th August 2004, but makes no commitment to do so.<br>
      <br>
      NomCom will contact by e-mail all those for whom it receives Recommendations 
      to request their submission of a Statement of Interest (see below), but 
      NomCom will only consider and select individuals who have submitted a completed 
      Statement of Interest.<br>
      <br>
      Statements of Interest must be received by the NomCom no later than <strong>12:00 
      GMT 25 August 2004</strong> for full consideration. NomCom will only consider 
      electronic submissions via e-mail.<br>
      <br>
      A recommendation is not required in the NomCom process. <br>
      <br>
      Note also that endorsements by organizations or groups and lists of signatories 
      are not appropriate for this Nominating Committee process, and they will 
      not be influential in NomCom’s selections since popularity is not one of 
      the criteria being used.<br>
      <br>
      The NomCom’s procedures for Confidential Treatment of Recommendations and 
      Statements of Interest call for confidential treatment of the identities 
      of Candidates and the NomCom’s discussions about the Candidates. <br>
      <br>
      The NomCom does not disclose externally whether individual candidates have 
      been recommended or who recommended them, and advises that you maintain 
      the confidentiality of your recommendation since the person you recommend 
      may not wish his/her candidacy to be disclosed. <br>
      <br>
      You are encouraged to review the instructions and form for submission of 
      Statements of Interest, and to note the more detailed explanation of confidentiality 
      in the NomCom process. <br>

      <strong><a name="HowtoSubmitaStatementofInterest"></a>I. How to Submit a 
      Statement of Interest </strong><br>
      <br>
      Any individual who wishes to be considered for selection by the NomCom must 
      complete an ICANN Nominating Committee Statement of Interest (see below), 
      in full, and return it to the NomCom. NomCom will only consider electronic 
      submissions via e-mail.<br>
      <br>
      For Full Consideration by the NomCom, the Statement of Interest must be 
      received by the NomCom no later than 12:00 GMT on 25 August 2004.<br>
      <br>
      It is in your best interest to submit your Statement of Interest as soon 
      as possible so that NomCom can follow up with your references or with you 
      if it has any questions.<br>
      <br>
      In order to enhance the candidate pool from which it will make its selections, 
      NomCom encourages submission of recommendations. Please note, however, that 
      a recommendation is not required in the NomCom process.<br>
      <br>
      Note also that endorsements by organizations or groups and lists of signatories 
      are not appropriate for this Nominating Committee process, and they will 
      not be influential in NomCom's selections since popularity is not one of 
      the criteria being used.<br>
      <br>
      The NomCom’s procedures for Confidential Treatment of Recommendations and 
      Statements of Interest call for confidential treatment of the identities 
      of Candidates and the NomCom’s discussions about the Candidates. In performing 
      its function, however, the NomCom will consult Candidates’ references and 
      conduct third-party reference checks on a confidential basis. Once selections 
      are made, the NomCom will make the identities of the Selected Nominees public. 
      Although NomCom will take reasonable steps to ensure that its confidentiality 
      procedures are followed, confidentiality cannot be assured and Candidates 
      and Selected Nominees shall have no claims against ICANN, the NomCom, or 
      affiliated persons in the event information is disclosed despite these procedures.<br>
      <br>
      By submitting a Statement of Interest, each Candidate authorizes the NomCom 
      to consult with the Candidate’s references and conduct third-party reference 
      checks. Each Candidate and Selected Nominee also agrees that he or she is 
      not entitled to review or access any of the information received, generated, 
      or considered by the NomCom regarding any Candidate or Selected Nominee, 
      or any of the NomCom’s discussions or deliberations regarding any Candidate 
      or Selected Nominee. Each Candidate and Selected Nominee acknowledges that 
      he or she has no right to challenge or seek review of the NomCom’s selections.<br>
      <br>
      For full consideration of your Statement of Interest please:  
	  <blockquote> a. complete in full the Statement of Interest below, using 
        English and plain text, and without the use of additional attachments; 
        <br>
        b. provide your responses to the Statement of Interest items in order, 
        immediately after the item;<br>
        c. make your response sufficient to stand alone without reliance on linked

        d. understand that the NomCom may not be able to review material that 
        you reference by URL links in your response; <br>
        e. provide the meaning of any acronyms used to reference an organization 
        or activity, and state the purpose of the organization or activity;<br>
        f. limit your responses to less than 3,500 words (in total) and focus 
        your responses carefully in terms of the nature of the position(s) for

        your candidacy;<br>
