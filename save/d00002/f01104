<h3>
  <p>An Unsatisifed Market</p>
</h3>

<p>
Netflix's recent promotion of their
<a href="http://signup.netflix.com/openconnect/software">
"Open Connect Appliance Software"</a>
is just the latest example of the rapidly growing trend of using
FreeBSD to build compelling products and services.  From the fare
meters in New York's taxi cabs, to network and storage appliances
used to run the Fortune 500, it's clear that FreeBSD is not just
"Turning PCs into Workstations" anymore.  Sustaining and accelerating
this momemtum requires understanding the changing face of FreeBSD's
user base, building relationships with these new consumers of
FreeBSD, and working together to make FreeBSD the most compelling
and cost effective application platform possible.  However, there
is a large roadblock in the path to this goal: a credible
marketplace offering FreeBSD support and services.
</p>

<p>
I'll use a hypothetical FreeBSD consumer to help illustrate the
problem.  Imagine a content delivery business which uses FreeBSD
as the OS platform for its servers.  Their job is to efficiently
distribute lots of data to their customer's end users, via
servers deployed all over the world.  The in-house staff focuses on
developing an application stack to manage the servers, monitor and
load balance network bandwidth usage, publish new content, and to
reap content that is no longer being distributed.
</p>

<p>
FreeBSD was chosen by this company because it offers high performance
and runs flawlessly on their initial hardware platform.  It just
works: no need to invest staff time or otherwise suffer distractions
from improving their CDN software stack.  But initial success does
not guarantee long term results.  Hardware becomes obsolete.  Will
FreeBSD fully support the systems available when it's time to replace
infrastructure?  Deployments grow.  Will FreeBSD scale with the
business?  Operating systems have bugs.  How does a FreeBSD consumer
protect itself from critical defects?
</p>

<p>
There are answers to these concerns.  FreeBSD has a strong and
dedicated community that, more often than not, diagnose and fix issues
in hours rather than days.  The size of the FreeBSD community means
that new hardware support is added to the operating system constantly,
often before your business needs these drivers.  FreeBSD's scalability
has improved in every release and is a focus of the FreeBSD community.
For almost any concern raised, an answer of similar form can be
honestly given.  But these are not the answers businesses are looking
for.
</p>

<p>
Where are the guarantees?  The FreeBSD community prides itself on
delivering an operating system with mission critical performance
and stability, but for many, that doesn't matter without mission
critical support.  You may retort, "You get what you pay for!"  The
thing is, these FreeBSD users have money to spend to obtain FreeBSD
support.  In fact they crave the ability to make it someone's paid
job to fix their problems.  They just struggle to spend their money
effectively.
</p>

<p>
When a problem crops up, they may try to hire a contractor only to
find that the pool of good contractors is small.  Not only do they
have to find someone in the community who can solve their problem,
but there is no guarantee that a contractor is available.  And
finding one good contractor may not be enough.  The perfect contractor
for last week's problem may not be an appropriate choice for fixing
the problem that cropped up today.  A business may incur significant
overhead finding, retaining, and managing the contractors they need.
</p>

<p>
Some businesses hire permanent staff to manage their use of FreeBSD,
but this is not without difficulties too.  First, hard questions
need to be answered.  Which areas of the OS will cause difficulty
in the future?  How many positions are needed and with what expertise?
When FreeBSD works well, what should be done with this staff?  In
reality, the permanent staff model only makes economic sense when
the product being developed requires heavy customization of FreeBSD
- having FreeBSD experts on staff is already critical to the
business plan.  Most other FreeBSD consumers would be happy to
outsource this function; let an entity that specializes in FreeBSD
support aggregate the demand and amortize the headcount costs across
several clients.  They want a Red Hat or SuSE for FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of how you feel about the real value of a Linux support
contract, the truth is that these services have a large perceived
value in the market place.  Finance departments and CTOs understand
the service contract model.  They also believe that a multi-billion
dollar company that specializes in support has a better chance of
fixing problems than home-grown efforts or community support.
</p>

<p>
FreeBSD is the passion of our community, but for most of its members,
not their job.  Having talked with dozens of commercial users of FreeBSD,
I've come to this conclusion that this missing economic connection
for getting work done in FreeBSD is the largest impediment to FreeBSD's
future success.  We need to grow the pool of administrators and
developers that are fluent in FreeBSD, and we need to build businesses
that pay for and deliver these skills to meet the current demand.
</p>

<p>
Solving the FreeBSD labor problem is a monumental task, but 
there are steps being taken today to address the issue. The 
FreeBSD Foundation is working to grow the potential FreeBSD 
labor pool by bringing FreeBSD into more universities so 
engineers and adminstrators are exposed to FreeBSD during 
their college course work. Companies like iXSystems are seeding 
the FreeBSD services marketplace. The BSD Certification Group 
provides certification exams for validating expertise on FreeBSD 
systems. And the FreeBSD community continues to improve its 
infrastructure so businesses can rapidly find the people and 
information needed to resolve their problems.
</p>

<p>
What can you do? Advertise your interest in the FreeBSD platform 
to vendors, recruiters, and educators to raise awareness of this 
market need. Invest in the FreeBSD community and FreeBSD education 
by supporting the FreeBSD Foundation. Patronize FreeBSD support 
businesses so they can develop their skills and capabilities. 
If you are a BSD expert, take the BSDA certification exam, or 
if you are an employer, include BSD certification as a requirement 
in your job postings. Most importantly, don't wait on the sidelines 
assuming building a viable FreeBSD marketplace is "not my job." 
We all have a role to play, and only together can we ensure the 
continued success of FreeBSD.

<h2><a name="Fundraising">Fundraising Update</a></h2>
<p>
<p><i>contributed by Deb Goodkin</i></p>

<p>
I just returned from OSCON, an open source conference in Portland,
Oregon. I had the pleasure of working the FreeBSD booth for a day.
Since I spend more time running the business side of our company,
I don't always have a chance to get out and promote the FreeBSD
operating system.  I can't even do justice to this after watching
Matt Olander enthusiastically promoting FreeBSD. I sat there with
my jaw dropped, in total amazement at how Matt, with his true passion
for FreeBSD,  can open up the most introverted person, and get them
talking about FreeBSD or maybe just their experience with open
source. When you listen to him explain the history and benefits of
FreeBSD, it makes you want to take a FreeBSD DVD and install the
OS right then and there.  It's people like this, with their incredible
passion, who make this such an amazing Project and community to be
involved in. And, Matt is just one of the many people I've met, who
are improving, promoting, and advocating FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation's mission is to promote and support the
FreeBSD Project and community worldwide. That means we fund project
development ($200k allocated), conferences, vendor, and developer
summits ($40,000 allocated), FreeBSD infrastructure ($125,000
allocated), travel grants ($20,000 allocated), and other expenses
including legal fees, travel expenses for visiting institutions and
corporations to help facilitate collaboration with the FreeBSD
Project,  and producing marketing literature to promote FreeBSD.
For 2012, we have budgeted $600,000 to spend on the Project, including
our operational expenses, with a goal of raising $500,000.
</p>

<p>
As of this publication we have raised $180,000. This time last year
we had raised around $154,000.  We receive most of
our funding the last few months of the year, which is very common
in the non-profit sector. But, it does make our job of supporting
FreeBSD interesting and  exciting!  How are we going to raise the
rest of the funds? Well, first we're going to ask for your help.
If you are reading this newsletter, most likely you are passionate
about FreeBSD. You can help by making a donation, asking your company
to make a donation, and/or spreading the word about FreeBSD and the
Foundation. Making a donation is easy. Just go to our donor page
at
<a href="/donate/">http://www.FreeBSDFoundation.org/donate/</a> 
and choose a donation option that is best for you.
</p>

<p>
Remember, by donating to the Foundation, you are supporting the
FreeBSD Project and community worldwide!

<p>
<h3><a name="Project4">NAND Flash Support</a></h3>
</p>
<p><i>contributed by Rafal Jaworowski</i></p>
<p>
It is my pleasure to confirm that in cooperation with The FreeBSD
Foundation and Juniper Networks, Semihalf has released to the
community the NAND Flash framework for FreeBSD which was developed
over the last few years.
</p>

<p>
The NAND Flash stack consists of a driver framework for NAND
controllers and memory chips, a NAND device simulator and a fault
tolerant, log-structured file system, accompanied by tools, utilities
and documentation.
</p>

<p>
With the NAND framework available, FreeBSD has been enabled as a
platform for embedded and industrial designs where a direct attached
NAND Flash is a typical and widespread solution.
</p>

<p>
The code was initially made public on a SVN projects branch, peer
reviewed and discussed over mailing lists, so that we could ensure
the NAND framework meets community standards and is easily maintained
and enhanced in the future.
</p>

<p>
It was then merged with FreeBSD HEAD in a series of commits beginning
with this one:
<a href="http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=235537">
http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=235537</a>
</p>

<p>
We'd like to thank the FreeBSD Foundation and Juniper Networks for
partnering with Semihalf on this technology transfer initiative.
Special thanks go to Semihalf development team (Grzegorz Bernacki,
Mateusz Guzik, Lukasz Plachno, Jan Sieka, Lukasz Wojcik) working
on this project.

<h3><a name="Project1">Growing Filesystems Online</a></h3>
</p>
<p><i>contributed by Edward Napierala</i></p>
<p>
The goal of this project was to make it possible to change the size
of mounted filesystems.  It's something that's very useful for
virtual machines - one can start with a small disk image, and then
scale it up as needed.  Previously, this required rebooting from
another disk.  The project involved changes at several levels in
the kernel, from disk drivers, to make it possible for the SCSI
disk driver to notice that the LUN size has changed, through GEOM,
making it possible to resize mounted partitions, to the filesystems
themselves.  Additionally, a possibility to resize LUNs exported
by CAM Target Layer was added.
</p>

<p>
<h3><a name="Project2">auditdistd</a></h3>
</p>
<p><i>contributed by Pawel Jakub Dawidek</i></p>

<p>
I'm happy to report that the auditdistd project I was working under
sponsorship from the FreeBSD Foundation is complete.
</p>

<p>
The auditdistd daemon is now part of the OpenBSM package and will
be available in its next release.
</p>

<p>
The auditdistd daemon nicely complements the audit framework. It
allows one to distribute audit records collected locally with minimal
latency to another system. This helps in postmortem analysis, as
we know that at least to some point in time audit logs stored on a
separate machine can be trusted. This is very important, because
once the system is compromised, we cannot trust any of its local
files.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important goals was to make the daemon very secure.
We really don't want any weakness in the auditdistd protocol to
allow a break into the machine where audit logs are collected. To
achieve this, the daemon makes heavy use of sandboxing mechanisms,
including Capsicum, if supported by the operating system.
</p>

<p>
The daemon can act as a sender, as a receiver, or as both. The whole
communication between two auditdistd daemons is secured by TLS
encryption. Low latency is achieved by using the kqueue mechanism
to monitor local trail files and by sending new audit records as
quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
For more information on how to setup auditdistd please visit its 
<a href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/auditdistd">wiki page</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to thank the FreeBSD Foundation for sponsoring this project
and I hope that it will meet the expectations of the FreeBSD
community.

<h3><a name="Project3">IPv6 Performance Analysis</a></h3>
</p>
<p><i>contributed by Bjoern Zeeb</i></p>
<p>
After working on IPv6 for many years now, seeing it finally being
used a lot more this year is exciting.  Since World IPv6 Launch
Day[1] my IPv6-only services are seeing a constant increase in
usage.  Other companies like Netflix have publicly announced that
they are using FreeBSD for their IPv6 enabled "Open Connect" CDN
[2], suddenly giving FreeBSD extra testing pushing lots of bits.
In light of all of this the IPv6 performance work has happened at
just about the right time.
</p>

<p>
Since its announcement[3] parts of the work have been committed to
FreeBSD and due to a number of requests, the changes will also be
part of the upcoming FreeBSD 9.1, allowing users to benefit from it
on a supported release.  I am very happy that some of the NIC vendors
have picked up the hardware assisted offload support for checksums,
Large/TCP Segment Offload (LSO/TSO) and Large Receive Offload (LRO)
support for IPv6 and provide it with their drivers.  Talking
to others, I know more are to follow.  The maintainers of SCTP have
also updated their code to make use of the new features, giving
improved performance for that protocol as well.
</p>

<p>
Having TCP/IPv6 performance on par with IPv4 in the offloading case,
allowing for full 10 Gbps line speed connections and UDP performance
being closer the to level of IPv4, is a huge step forward.
</p>

<p>
More patches allowing for better parallelism are in the queue or
out for review already, so you can expect further improvements in
the future allowing you to also see better performance even without
the hardware offloading support.  However with the forthcoming
release, the focus has to be on a stable stack.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to thank the FreeBSD Foundation and iXsystems for having
sponsored the project, George Neville-Neil for doing reviews, Michael
Tuexen for updating the SCTP, Navdeep Parhar at Chelsio for the
driver updates, Jack Vogel at Intel, and Andrew Gallatin at Myricom
for his help, as well as everyone else who helped or is picking up
testing and using IPv6 on FreeBSD.

<h3><a name="Project5">Capsicum Component Framework</a></h3>
</p>
<p><i>contributed by Pawel Jakub Dawidek</i></p>
<p>
Capsicum is a novel hybrid capability model that first appeared in
FreeBSD 9.0, targeted at application compartmentalization: the
mitigation of security vulnerabilities through decomposition of
complex and risky applications into isolated components.
</p>

<p>
Capsicum provides tight sandboxing mechanism where
access to all global name spaces is restricted and also allows to
limit actions that can be performed on file descriptors (file
descriptors represent capabilities).
</p>

<p>
There are many attempts to implement the former functionality with
existing tools, such as chroot(2) and dropping privileges with
setuid(2) and friends.  Unfortunately this doesn't solve the problem.
Such a sandbox can still access various global name spaces, like
process table, and can even make internet connections. If an attacker's
goal is to build a spam botnet, having machines that can connect
to the internet is all he needs. He doesn't need full root access
to the system.
</p>

<p>
The latter functionality is very important as well. Without Capsicum,
a file descriptor that is open for reading can only still be subject
to fchmod(2), fchown(2) and other system calls.
</p>

<p>
Capsicum is very powerful, but it requires breaking an application
into multiple processes that communicate through some IPC mechanism.
This can complicate an application's design greatly.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to provide an easy to use API that can simplify sandbox
management and communication between processes. The easier it will
be, the bigger chances to wider adoption and less work to convert
existing applications to use Capsicum.  At this point I have a
pretty complete design of the new libcapsicum API and "Casper" - a
system-wide daemon that will provide various services to sandboxed
applications, like DNS name resolution for instance.

<h3><a name="Project6">iSCSI Scoping</a></h3>
</p>
<p><i>contributed by Edward Napierala</i></p>
<p>
This was a short project to research what's necessary to develop a
kernel-based iSCSI target, based on the CAM Target Layer, and supporting
hardware offload implemented by modern network adapters, the iSER
("iSCSI over RDMA," so to say) in particular.  It required reading
RFCs, experimenting with other implementations to figure out what's
nice and what mistakes to avoid, figuring out the organizational
mess with iWARP and OFED in general, and glancing at Linux sources.
The next step now is to use that knowledge - to actually write
the target.

<h3><a name="BSDCan">BSDCan 2012</a></h3>
<p><i>contributed by Dan Langille</i></p>
<p>
For the 7th consecutive year, The FreeBSD Foundation has sponsored
BSDCan, an important fixture in the conference calendar.  BSDCan
started small in 2004 and slowly grew to become one of the leading
BSD conferences.  It now enjoys a high level of participation from
a wide cross section of the global BSD community.
</p>

<p>
Every year, our biggest costs continue to be travel and accommodation.
Without the sponsorship afforded to us by our sponsors, such as the
FreeBSD Foundation, we would not be able to retain the talented
speakers that we have become known for.  Good talks bring more
people.  More people leads to planning and sharing of great ideas
that form the foundations of a great community.  Work done remotely
is not the same as work done collectively in one location.  There
is no substitute for good relationships and camaraderie.  BSDCan
provides a welcoming and friendly atmosphere for this.
</p>


<h3><a name="AsiaBSDCon">AsiaBSDCon 2012</a></h3>
<p><i>contributed by Hiroki Sato</i></p>
<p>
AsiaBSDCon 2012, the 7th BSD conference in Asia, was held on March
22-25, 2012, in Tokyo, Japan.  This conference consists of 4 days:
a 2-day tutorial/meeting session and a 2-day paper session.  There
were 8 tutorials (6 in English and 2 in Japanese) and the number
of students were 4-20 for each.  The paper session had 11 papers
and 1 keynote. The number of attendees was 105.
</p>

<p>
This year's keynote was "Embedded Technology and BSD UNIX in Japan"
by Shozo Takeoka, the founder of AXE, Inc., a vendor which provides
custom-ordered network equipment based on BSD, middleware for
cellphones, embedded BSD, and embedded Linux to major home appliance
and digital camera manufacturers in Japan.
</p>

<p>
In the 2-day meeting session George Neville-Neil and I held a
half-day Vendor Summit.  About 30 people attended the session and
talks were given in English and Japanese by George (past Vendor
Summmit), myself (Foundation), Brooks Davis (toolchain), Michal
Dubiel (Semihalf), Masaru Oki (Internet Initiative Japan), and Shozo
Takeoka (what and why of BSD-BA).  Shozo Takeoka, myself, and others
are planning to set up an organization "BSD-BA (BSD Business
Association)", a Japanese BSD consortium.
</p>


<p>
Overall, everything went well.  And it is notable that there have
been several moves to improve the situation of Japanese vendors
using BSD.  I am also working towards this goal and will keep the
Foundation up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
The tentative date for the next AsiaBSDCon is March 14-17, 2013.

<h3><a name="BSDDay">BSD-Day 2012</a></h3>
<p><i>contributed by Gabor Pali</i></p>

<p>
The purpose of the <a href="http://bsdday.eu/2012">BSD-Days</a>
is to gather Central European developers and users of today's
open-source BSD systems, popularize their work, and provide an
interface for real-life communication.  The event therefore features
several BSD developers and enthusiasts to tell about their work,
communicate with their fellows and reach their potential future
partners.
</p>

<p>
There are no formalities, papers, registration or participation
fee, however the invited folks are encouraged to give a brief talk
about their favorite BSD-related topic.  The language of this event
is English, and the goal is to motivate everybody, especially
university students, to work with BSD systems.  We believe this way
developers can get to know each other better and attract more users
to learn about new projects and meet the involved parties in person,
and eventually join the efforts.  Our talks were arranged on a
voluntary basis -- motivated by alleviating the amount of administration
required for presentation.  Instead of having a program committee
to set a standard, we are trying to help the speakers in working
out their talks if needed.
</p>

<p>
For this year, the event was co-located with the Austrian Linuxweeks
(Linuxwochen Osterreich) in Vienna on May 5, 2012 (Saturday).  We
had the FreeBSD Foundation as our main sponsor, together with many
others who are also closely related to BSD.  The support of the Foundation
enabled us to cover the incurring costs, therefore to invite 13 BSD
committers for a breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire day,
as an appreciation of their work.  We are really grateful for this
generous donation.
</p>

<p>
For the evening before the event, we organized our usual beer meetup
(or "stammtisch" as they are called in Austrian) in the downtown
of the beautiful Vienna, at a place called Kolar.  There we welcomed
the incoming visitors and speakers and had a dinner and some beers
in a very good mood and discussed the final issues related to the
event.
</p>

<p>
On the next day, the event featured people working with FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD and touched the following topics: using an
embedded NetBSD system to do VOIP calls, introduction to the Capsicum
security framework, relayd, the load balancer and proxy solution
for OpenBSD (that has been also ported to FreeBSD recently), new
features in the FreeBSD ports tree, using DVCSs as cloud solutions,
firewalling with pfSense, and finally a presentation on mfsBSD.
All of those talks are available on
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bsddayeu">YouTube at the "bsddayeu" channel</a>,
and one is free to check out our event photo album available through the 
<a href= "https://picasaweb.google.com/116452848880746560170/BSDDay2012?authkey=Gv1sRgCN3twLrxuaeongE">web site</a>.
We honored each of the speakers with a nice gift package that
included a traditional Austrian wine and a Certificate of Appreciation.
During one of the afternoon breaks, we even invited our audience
to share a cake with us to encourage the feeling of being part of
a great and caring family!
</p>

<p>
As a gratis, Paul Schenkeveld (one of the key people behind the
EuroBSDcon Foundation) announced that he created a
<a href="http://bsdcommunity.eu/">site</a>
for coordinating efforts of European BSD users groups at the end
of the event.  According to him, it would be a place to collect and
maintain event calendars, reports, and pictures of conferences in
the region, and potentially share experiences and promotional
materials.
</p>

<p>
We believe that the funds invested from the side of the Foundation
will pay off gradually because the more users we can motivate the
more donors there will be for the Foundation, and thus for the
FreeBSD community.  Furthermore, we aim to support the local BSD
user groups this way, so they can get in touch with larger audiences
in their home country, and make BSD an appealing alternative to
local companies.  We promoted our event in the BSD Magazine primarily,
but our advertisement appeared at many other frequented German and
Austrian sites, e.g.
<a href="http://www.heise.de/open/veranstaltungskalender/Central-European-BSD-Day-2012-1557480.html">heise.de</a>.
In addition, because BSD-Day is a multi-project event, we feel that
it contributes to a better cooperation between the participating
projects, for which relayd turned out to be an excellent example.
</p>

<p>
We hope to carry on with this successful series next
year, somewhere around Central Europe.  Do not forget that you can
also be part of this enterprise and help us by donating to the
FreeBSD Foundation!


<h3><a name="DevSummit">Ottawa Developer Summit 2012</a></h3>
<p><i>contributed by John Baldwin</i></p>
<p>
A FreeBSD Developers Summit was held May 9th, 10th, and 11th in
Ottawa, Canada alongside the BSDCan 2012 conference.  Seventy FreeBSD
developers and forty-one guests attended the summit making it the
largest summit to date.  Breakout sessions were held on the first two 
days of the summit on a wide range of topics including Documentation, 
Offload Engines, Ports and Packages, Virtualization, and the Network 
Stack.  Several developers presented talks during a developers
summit track open to all BSDCan attendees on May 11th.
</p>

<p>
Attendees networked at a casual, summit-wide dinner on Thursday
evening, the 10th and stayed up until the wee hours of the morning
each day hacking code, discussing ideas, and swapping stories in the
Hacking Lounge.  The hacking, discussions, and networking continued
during the BSDCan conference.
</p>

<p>
The developers summit would not have been possible without generous
support from sponsors including The FreeBSD Foundation and BSDCan.
All of the developers and guests who chaired and participated in
breakout sessions and gave talks also contributed greatly to the
summit's success.
</p>

<h3><a name="VendorSummit">Ottawa Vendor Summit 2012</a></h3>

<p><i>contributed by George Neville-Neil</i></p>

<p>The Vendor Summit at BSDCan in May of 2012 was our fourth summit to
  date.  The first summit was held in May of 2011, and was followed by
  a summit in Silicon Valley at the NetApp campus, as well as a summit
  held at AsiaBSDCon in Tokyo in March of this year.
<p>Each Summit has differed slightly from the previous ones.  The
  Silicon Valley Summit included a full day of Tutorials, taught by
  John Baldwin and Kirk McMusick.  The AsiaBSDCon Summit included
  presentations by Japanese companies using FreeBSD as well as
  Semihalf, a company working on support for embedded systems.
<p>This year's BSDCan Vendor Summit followed closely the format set
  down in the first summit in 2011.  Sixty participants signed up
  representing more than 20 companies as well as the FreeBSD Project
  itself.  For two and a half hours three main areas were discussed:
  What did the companies have that they could share, what were the
  things that people were working on which would arrive soon, and what
  did the project and the companies involved see as necessary to
  complete in the next six months.  A few highlights from the list of
  technologies or code that were about to go into FreeBSD, and which
  have now been integrated, include support for ARM 6 and 7, Applied
  Micro and FreeScale processors, the NAND Flash File System, DTrace
  support on by default in the GENERIC kernel, integration of the
  DTrace Toolkit, the ability to grow filesystems at runtime (which
  was funded by the Foundation), and several more.  In all we went
  through over 100 items on the three lists, and most of these were
  taking up by individual contributors to make sure they made it into
  future releases.
<p>The Foundation arranged for dinner to be brought in for all the
  participants, and the meeting ended just in time, as dinner arrived.
  Another Silicon Valley Summit is being planned for November of 2012.

<h3><a name="Research">Research Highlights</a></h3>
<p><i>contributed by George Neville-Neil</i></p>

<p>One of the key differentiators for the FreeBSD project is the level
  of research that is done with FreeBSD itself.  All of the major
  areas of system and language research are well represented in the
  papers that are accepted for publications by various journals and
  conferences each year.  This is a small sampling of the research
  carried out on FreeBSD in the last year.

<h2><a name="A-Team">A-Team Systems</a></h2>

<p>
A-Team Systems provides FreeBSD centric server administration and 
monitoring services across the globe.  Our clients know that FreeBSD 
delivers great performance and rock solid reliability through 
first-hand experience.
</p>

<p>
The consistent, unified and stable platform FreeBSD provides allows 
us to easily deploy and maintain dozens of servers, drastically 
reducing maintenance time and costs for our clients when compared 
to other server operating systems.
</p>

<p>
In addition to server management, we also provide web development 
and hosting services. FreeBSD gives our low volume clients inexpensive 
shared hosting without trading off security or performance.
</p>

<p>
For larger customers, we create clusters using FreeBSD to provide 
high availability and load balancing.  FreeBSD's excellent built in 
firewall features such as PF, IPFW and CARP make it the ideal server 
operating system.
</p>

<p>
When used in conjunction with other open source software, such as Apache HTTPd, 
FreeBSD virtually eliminates the need for expensive specialized hardware
such as load balancers.  We've seen great success with clusters using 
CARP and mod_proxy_loadbalancer on front end firewall and proxy servers 
with an-easy to scale pool of back-end web and and DB servers.
</p>

<p>
FreeBSD excels at meeting Internet infrastructure needs, from servers to 
firewalling. A-Team Systems is proud to put FreeBSD front and center of 
its service offerings and we are grateful to the entire FreeBSD team for 
continuing to provide such an excellent platform.
</p>

<p>
Without FreeBSD, our customers and the Internet at large wouldn't be where 
they are today and neither would we!
