<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
News::Gateway is a general toolkit for mail to news and news to mail
gatewaying, robomoderation, and human moderation support.  It's a Perl
module designed to be as extensible and general as possible, and to
provide a framework and a way of collecting previous work so that each
person who wants to do things like the above doesn't have to reinvent the
wheel.
</p>

<p>
Although I'm using the current version to moderate the newsgroups I
moderate and to gateway news to mail and mail to news here at Stanford,
and it works well for what it does, it could do a lot more and be quite a
bit easier to use.  Unfortunately, it's fallen off the bottom of my
priority list and has gone multiple years without serious attention.  I
have a significant overhaul and substantial improvement to thet
documentation and interface, as well as including many other accumulated
fixes, in progress in its Git repository, but I have no idea when I'll
have time to release it.
</p>

<p>
If I ever make another release, more information will show up here (such
as documentation and change log information like I have for my other
software).
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>
News::Gateway depends on Andrew Gierth's News::Article and on Net::NNTP,
which is part of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/libnet/">libnet</a>.  News::Article also requires my
<a href="../pgp-sign/">PGP::Sign</a> module.
</p>

<p>
Perl 5.003 or later is also required.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
