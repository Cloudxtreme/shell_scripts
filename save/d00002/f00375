        </b></p>

      <p> NomCom members developed and reached consensus on a Code of Ethics to 

        which all NomCom members and NomCom staff have expressed their commitment 

        to adhere. The Code of Ethics includes the following statement on Conflicts 

        of Interest:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>&quot;NomCom members are expected to adhere to the ICANN Conflicts 

          of Interest Policy). Each NomCom member must disclose promptly to the 

          Chair any financial or other relations that might affect (or might reasonably 

          be seen to affect) his/her performance on the Committee, including any 

          financial connections to any individual under consideration by the NomCom. 

          A Subcommittee will be formed by the Chair to review disclosed conflicts 

          or potential conflicts and to determine how to handle them. NomCom members 

          must recuse themselves from participation in discussion and voting where 

          such conflict exists.&quot; [Excerpt from <a href="/procedures-10apr03.htm#A1">NomCom 

          Procedures, Section A, paragraph 1</a>]</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The NomCom Subcommittee on Conflicts of Interest is charged to administer 

        and monitor compliance with the ICANN Conflicts of Interest Policy as 

        applicable to the work of the NomCom. [For the ICANN Conflicts of Interest 

        Policy see <a href="http://www.icann.org/committees/coi/coi-policy-04mar99.htm">http://www.icann.orghttp://www.icann.org/committees/coi/coi-policy-04mar99.htm</a>].</p>

      <p> The Subcommittee's duties and those of NomCom in relation to conflict 

        of interest matters are described below:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><a name="1"></a>1. The Subcommittee will take appropriate steps to 

          ensure that the NomCom members and NomCom staff remain aware of their 

          responsibilities for prompt disclosure to the Chair of NomCom of the 

          existence and nature of any financial or other relations that might 

          affect (or reasonably be seen to affect) his/her performance on the 

          Committee, including any financial connections to any Candidate or employer 

          of any Candidate under consideration by the NomCom. This disclosure 

          must be made prior to the NomCom's detailed discussion surrounding the 

          Candidate concerned.</p>

        <p>The NomCom Chair will refer disclosures from members and staff of the 

          NomCom to the Subcommittee and will also refer to the Subcommittee any 

          actual or potential conflicts of interest that are identified otherwise. 

          For matters pending before the full NomCom, a referral to the Subcommittee 

          on Conflicts of Interest will not be required where the NomCom member 

          or NomCom staff concerned fully discloses to the NomCom his or her financial 

          or other interest and abstains from participation in the NomCom's consideration 

          of the matter. The disclosure may be made either to the NomCom members 

          involved in the discussion(s) or meeting(s) during which abstention 

          occurs, or beforehand to the NomCom Chair.</p>

        <p><a name="2"></a>2. Once actual or potential conflicts of interest have 

          been referred to the Subcommittee, the disinterested members of the 

          Subcommittee on Conflicts of Interest shall promptly determine whether 

          a conflict of interest exists. Except as provided for in paragraph 2, 

          the NomCom shall not vote or reach consensus on a matter under its consideration, 

          including but not limited to determining or carrying out its processes 

          for selection of Nominees, in connection with which an actual or potential 

          conflict of interest has been disclosed until such time as the Subcommittee 

          on Conflicts of Interest has addressed the actual or potential conflict 

          of interest.</p>

        <p><a name="3"></a>3. Where a matter has been referred to the Subcommittee 

          on Conflicts of Interest and the Subcommittee has concluded that a conflict 

          of interest exists, the Subcommittee will notify the Chair of NomCom 

          and the NomCom member or NomCom staff concerned of the necessity of 

          the member's or staff's abstention from participation in the NomCom's 

          consideration of the matter in question. Where appropriate, the Subcommittee 

          will determine the extent of the abstention required.</p>

        <p><a name="4"></a>4. If the Subcommittee on Conflicts of Interest has 

          reasonable cause to believe that a NomCom member or NomCom staff has 

          failed to disclose an actual or potential conflict of interest, it shall 

          inform the NomCom member or NomCom staff of the basis for such belief 

          in writing and afford the NomCom member or NomCom staff a written opportunity 

          to explain the alleged failure to disclose. The written communications 

          shall be made via e-mail or fax.</p>

        <p>If, after considering the response of the NomCom member or NomCom staff 

          and making such further investigation as may be warranted in the circumstances, 

          the Subcommittee on Conflicts of Interest determines that the NomCom 

          member or NomCom staff has in fact failed to disclose an actual or potential 

          conflict of interest, it shall recommend to the NomCom appropriate disciplinary 

          and corrective action. In the case of a NomCom staff failure to disclose, 

          the NomCom will also refer the matter to the Corporation.</p>

        <p><a name="5"></a>5. The violation of the Conflict of Interest policy 

          is a serious matter and may constitute &quot;cause&quot; for removal 

          of the NomCom member by NomCom in accordance with its Procedures or 

          termination of the NomCom staff in accordance with the Corporation's 

          policies.</p>

        <p><a name="6"></a>6. The Subcommittee on Conflicts of Interest shall 

          keep records of its proceedings. </p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><a name="6a"></a>a. The Minutes of the Subcommittee on Conflicts 

            of Interest shall contain:</p>

          <blockquote> 

            <p>(1) The names of NomCom members found to have a material financial 

              interest or other relation in connection with an actual or possible 

              conflict of interest; the nature of the financial interest or other 

              relation; any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest 

              was present; and the decision of the Subcommittee on Conflicts of 

              Interest as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.</p>

            <p>(2) The names of the persons who were present for discussions and 

              votes relating to the actual or potential conflict of interest; 

              the content of the discussion; and a record of any votes taken in 

              connection therewith.</p>

            </blockquote>

          <p><a name="6b"></a>b. The Subcommittee shall also keep sufficient records 

            to be able to report to NomCom and, upon request, to the Corporation 

            on the matters referred to the Subcommittee and their resolution. 

            At the time the 2003 Nominating Committee completes its term and is 

            discharged, the Chair will arrange for one anonymized report of conflict 

            situations to be sent to the Corporation for the purpose of building 

            a tradition for how to handle conflicts of interest. </p>

        </blockquote>

        <p><a name="7"></a>7. In connection with a conflict of interest, the Minutes 

          of the NomCom shall contain the names of the persons who were present 

          for discussions and votes relating to the NomCom matter concerned; the 

          content of the discussion, and a record of any votes taken in connection 

          therewith.<font face="Arial"> </font></p>
