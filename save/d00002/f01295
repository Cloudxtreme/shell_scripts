      <p><b><a name="A"></a>A. Code of Ethics for NomCom Members</b></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b><a name="A1"></a>1. Integrity and Conflict of Interest</b></p>

        <p>NomCom members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet 

          community and within the scope of the ICANN mission and responsibilities 

          assigned to it by the ICANN Bylaws. The NomCom is designed to function 

          independently from the ICANN Board, the Supporting Organizations, and 

          Advisory Committees.</p>

        <p>NomCom members are expected to adhere to the ICANN Conflict of Interest 

          Policy. Each NomCom member must disclose promptly to the Chair any financial 

          or other relations that might affect (or might reasonably be seen to 

          affect) his/her performance on the Committee, including any financial 

          connections to any individual under consideration by the NomCom. A subcommittee 

          will be formed by the Chair to review disclosed conflicts or potential 

          conflicts and to determine how to handle them. NomCom members must recuse 

          themselves from participation in discussion and voting where such conflict 

          exists.</p>

        <p>NomCom members must not have any pre-existing commitments concerning 

          the nomination of any particular candidates or potential candidates.</p>

        <p>Each NomCom member is expected to pursue the stated objectives of the 

          Committee, to comply with the rules and procedures established by the 

          Committee, and to support the decisions the Committee makes.</p>

        <p>Each NomCom member is expected to do his/her best to find the highest-qualified 

          candidates for consideration by the NomCom, and to do his/her best to 

          encourage those individuals to serve.</p>

        <p>At no time shall any member of NomCom act in a way that would bring 

          the Committee into disrepute or undermine the integrity of the process 

          by which the Committee makes its selections.</p>

        <p><b><a name="A2"></a>2. Confidentiality and Privacy</b></p>

        <p>All NomCom members will safeguard all internal NomCom communications 

          and treat them as strictly private, confidential, and for the use of 

          immediate committee members and NomCom staff only, without exception.</p>

        <p>NomCom members will not disclose outside of the Committee any of the 

          discussions about the candidates. Further, NomCom members will not disclose 

          outside of the Committee the identities of candidates under consideration 

          by NomCom, unless NomCom as a whole has decided to do so and the explicit 

          consent of the candidate(s) in question has been obtained.</p>

        <p><b><a name="A3"></a>3. Agreement to Adhere to the Code of Ethics</b></p>

        <p>Each NomCom member must adhere to this Code of Ethics. Failure to do 

          so will constitute grounds for removal from the NomCom.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><b><a name="B"></a>B. NomCom's Role and Objectives</b></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b><a name="B1"></a>1. Role</b></p>

        <p>NomCom is responsible for the selection of all ICANN Directors except 

          the President and those selected by ICANN's Supporting Organizations, 

          and for such other selections as are set forth in the Bylaws. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VII-1">Bylaws 

          Article VII, Section 1</a>]</p>

        <p>NomCom selections are final; no further approval or ratification is 

          needed.</p>

        <p>NomCom members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet 

          community and within the scope of the ICANN Mission and the responsibilities 

          assigned to NomCom by the ICANN Bylaws.</p>

        <p>The objective of ICANN’s new nominating process is to balance the Supporting 

          Organization-based and constituency-based selection of Directors and 

          individuals for other positions to ensure that ICANN can benefit from 

          participants of the highest integrity and capability who place the public 

          interest ahead of any particular interests, but who are nevertheless 

          knowledgeable about the environment in which ICANN operates.</p>

        <p><b><a name="B2"></a>2. Objectives</b></p>

        <p>The following are the core objectives of the NomCom:</p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p>1. Identify, recruit, and nominate the highest-quality nominees for 

            the positions NomCom is charged to fill;</p>

          <p>2. Advance the core mission and values of ICANN [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#I">Bylaws 

            Article I, Sections 1 and 2</a>];</p>

          <p>3. Trust and respect all members of the NomCom;</p>

          <p>4. Pursue diversity in geography, culture, skills, experience, and 

            perspectives from across the global Internet community;</p>

          <p>5. Earn trust and respect of the Internet community by acting with 

            fairness and integrity, and by providing transparency of objectives, 

            criteria, procedures, and mechanisms for receiving input, while respecting 

            candidates’ privacy and maintaining the confidentiality that is necessary 

            to assure open and frank communications within NomCom; and </p>

          <p>6. Adhere to the ICANN Bylaws.</p>

      <p><b><a name="C"></a>C. NomCom Operating Procedures</b></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b><a name="C1"></a>1. Modifications to NomCom Procedures</b></p>

        <p>Considerable care has been taken in developing the NomCom Procedures. 

          The NomCom process, however, is new to ICANN. In setting and publicizing 

          its procedures, the NomCom reserves the right to modify them in the 

          course of its work in order to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in 

          fulfilling its responsibilities. If NomCom concludes that modification 

          of these procedures is necessary, NomCom will post the changes on the 

          NomCom web page.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C2"></a>2. Responsibilities of NomCom Members</b></p>

        <p>NomCom members are expected to engage in outreach, recruitment, and 

          consultations; to read the submitted and gathered information about 

          each candidate under consideration; to participate in NomCom teleconferences; 

          to work diligently with NomCom colleagues toward an overall consensus 

          on the best possible group of candidates to be selected; and to adhere 

          to the Code of Ethics.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C3"></a>3. Vacancies and Removal from NomCom</b><br>

          <br>

          Vacancies that may occur in NomCom may be filled for the remainder of 

          the term vacated by the same means by which the position was initially 

          filled.</p>

        <p>A NonCom member may be removed, following notice to the member, and 

          if selected by a Supporting Organization, to that Supporting Organizations, 

          by a majority vote of all NomCom members entitled to vote; provided, 

          however, that the member who is the subject of the removal action shall 

          not be entitled to vote on such an action or be counted as a voting 

          member of NomCom when calculating the required majority vote; and provided 

          further, that each vote to remove a member shall be a separate vote 

          on the sole question of the removal of that particular member.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C4"></a>4. Language for Conduct of NomCom's Communications</b></p>

        <p>NomCom will conduct its communications in English.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C5"></a>5. Terminology</b></p>

        <p>The term &quot;Candidate&quot; will be reserved for those individuals 

          who agree to be considered by the NomCom for whom all required information 

          in the Statement of Interest has been received.</p>

        <p>The term &quot;Nominee&quot; is reserved to refer to a Candidate selected 

          by NomCom for a position it is charged to fill. NomCom selections are 

          final; no further approval or ratification is needed.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C6"></a>6. Internal Communications and Relations</b></p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p> <i><a name="C6a"></a>a. Communications</i></p>

          <p>NomCom will carry out its work primarily through teleconferences 

            and email. Materials for NomCom’s work should normally be distributed 

            at least 48 hours in advance of teleconference meetings.</p>

          <p>The Chair will seek to facilitate confidential communications in 

            a way that makes the most sense for the NomCom members.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C6b"></a>b. Volunteer Service</i></p>

          <p>NomCom members serve as volunteers, without compensation. This contribution 

            is respected and appreciated. Provisions will be made to alleviate 

            the financial burden of the NomCom’s frequent teleconferences. Without 

            prior approval from the Chair for the incurrence of expenditure, reimbursement 

            will not be made for any other expenditures.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C6c"></a>c. Non-Voting Members</i></p>

          <p>Except for formal votes, non-voting members of the NomCom will take 

            part in all NomCom activities on an equal basis with voting members.</p>

          <p>All NomCom members may participate in all discussions and deliberations 

            (unless a conflict of interest has been determined to be present).</p>

          <p><i><a name="C6d"></a>d. Access to Information</i></p>

          <p>The Chair will maintain a non-public central roster of Candidates 

            under consideration, including available background and professional 

            information. All NomCom members will have access to the information 

            in the central roster. The central roster is confidential to NomCom 

            members and NomCom staff.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C7"></a>7. External Communications and Relations</b></p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i><a name="C7a"></a>a. Transparency</i></p>

          <p>The NomCom will publish its rules and procedures at its web page 

            on the ICANN Website. In consultation with the NomCom, the Chair will 

            establish and publicize milestones and deadlines, including the public 

            call for recommendations, so as to allow the NomCom to complete its 

            work in a timely way.<br>

            The Chair will serve as the official spokesperson for NomCom.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C7b"></a></i>b. Recruitment Consultations</p>

          <p>The NomCom will engage proactively in consultations with the various 

            elements of the ICANN community in its recruitment efforts. Such contacts 

            will include the IETF, the DNS root name server operators, the regional 

            Internet registries, the Address Council, the gTLD and ccTLD registries 

            and registrars, the Council and constituencies of the GNSO, the technical 

            liaison group and the Security and At Large Advisory Committees.</p>

          <p>The success of the NomCom will depend in no small measure on the 

            willingness of NomCom members to engage in affirmative recruitment 

            of excellent candidates.</p>

          <p>In order to encourage NomCom members do their best to identify and 

            recruit outstanding candidates, each NomCom member will be asked to 

            present a list of at least 5 possible candidates for each of the bodies 

            to be populated in part by the NomCom.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C7c"></a>c. Public Input</i></p>

          <p>The NomCom will call publicly for Recommendations and Statements 

            of Interest from across the global Internet community to find the 

            talent and experience needed for the positions it fills, to inform 

            NomCom’s decisions, and to generate the confidence and respect of 

            the community for those whom NomCom selects.</p>

          <p>The NomCom will use all available means to publicize the call for 

            Recommendations and Statements of Interest.</p>

          <p>A Recommendation is not a requirement for consideration by the NomCom.</p>

          <p>The Chair will give at least 30 days for the public to submit Recommendations 

            and Statements of Interest.</p>

          <p>Because NomCom will conduct its work in English, all submissions 

            to NomCom must be provided in English. In <a href="/formal-call-05apr03.htm">NomCall's 

            Formal Call for Recommendations and Statements of Interest</a> NomCom 

            grants permission for translation of the Formal Call provided (1) 

            any distributed translation includes the full text of the Formal Call 

            in English in its entirety and without any changes and (2) a copy 

            of the translation and the identity and contact information for the 

            translator are sent to NomCom at &lt;<a href="mailto:nomcom.comments@icann.org">nomcom.comments@icann.org</a>&gt;.</p>

          <p>All Recommendations and Statements of Interest will be acknowledged 

            in a timely fashion, using the address information provided by the 

            submitter.</p>

          <p>NomCom will provide a one-way communication mechanism (email or web-based) 

            through which the public can easily provide input to assist the NomCom 

            in its work. See section d below regarding the confidential treatment 

            of input received about specific candidates via this mechanism.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C7d"></a>d. Confidentiality and Privacy</i></p>

          <p>All NomCom members will safeguard all internal NomCom communications 

            and treat them as strictly private, confidential, and for the use 

            of immediate committee members and NomCom staff only, without exception.</p>

          <p>NomCom members will not disclose outside of the committee the identities 

            of Candidates under consideration by the NomCom, nor any discussions 

            about them, unless both the Candidate and the NomCom as a whole have 

            given explicit authorization to disclose the information.</p>

          <p>Note that because NomCom will need to check references and consult 

            selected third-party sources on a confidential basis before making 

            its final selections, those wishing to be considered Candidates are 

            required to confirm this understanding of the confidentiality arrangements 

            when they submit a Statement of Interest. NomCom also reserves the 

            right to disclose the identities of those who submit Recommendations 

            when it is necessary to do so in the course of the review process.</p>

          <p>When NomCom has completed its selection of Nominees for the positions 

            it is charged to fill, NomCom will, of course, publish the identities 

            of the Nominees.</p>

          <p>Statistical information, without identifying information, may be 

            published. For example, information about the size and nature of the 

            Candidate pool.</p>

        <p><b><a name="C8"></a>8. Criteria for Selection for ICANN Directors, 

          GNSO Council Members, and Interim ALAC Members</b></p>

        <p>In selecting Nominees of the highest integrity and capability, the 

          NomCom will apply the criteria for selection and terms of eligibility, 

          defined in the applicable ICANN Bylaws, to identify a pool of qualified 

          Candidates.</p>

        <p>To select from this pool of qualified Candidates, NomCom will take 

          into account additional considerations, related to the roles to be filled, 

          that it finds important as progress in the selection process is made.</p>

        <p>By doing so, the NomCom seeks to ensure that ICANN can benefit from 

          those who place the public interest ahead of any particular special 

          interests, but who are nevertheless knowledgeable about the environment 

          in which ICANN operates.</p>

        <p>In doing so, the NomCom also implements <a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#I-2.4">ICANN's 

          Core Values</a> to seek and support broad, informed participation reflecting 

          the functional, geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at 

          all levels of policy development and decision-making.</p>

              the powers of ICANN, controlling its property, and conducting or 

              directing its business and affairs, except as otherwise provided 

              in the ICANN Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. Directors serve 

              as individuals who have the duty to act in what they reasonably 

              believe are the best interests of ICANN and not as representatives 

              of the entity that selected them, their employers, or any other 

              organizations or constituencies. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#II-1">Bylaws

            <li>The Interim ALAC is to consider and provide advice on the activities 

              of ICANN, insofar as they relate to the interests of individual 

              users. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#XI-2.4">Bylaws

          </ul>

          <p>NomCom will use for all of these positions the criteria in the Bylaws 

            for selection of ICANN Directors. See below. NomCom may use some additional 

            considerations for the GNSO Council and Interim ALAC positions to 

            support the specific roles of these entities.</p>

          <p><i><a name="C8b"></a>b. Criteria for Selection of ICANN Directors</i></p>

          <p>&quot;ICANN Directors shall be:</p>

          <blockquote> 

            <p>(i). Accomplished persons of integrity, objectivity, and intelligence, 

              with reputations for sound judgement and open minds, and a demonstrated 

              capacity for thoughtful group decision-making;</p>

            <p>(ii). Persons with an understanding of ICANN's mission and the 

              potential impact of ICANN decisions on the global Internet community, 

              and committed to the success of ICANN;</p>

            <p>(iii). Persons who will produce the broadest cultural and geographic 

              diversity on the Board consistent with meeting the other criteria 

              set forth in this Section;</p>

            <p>(iv) Persons who, in the aggregate, have personal familiarity with 

              the operation of gTLD registries and registrars; with ccTLD registries; 

              with IP address registries; with Internet technical standards and 

              protocols; with policy-development procedures, legal traditions, 

              and the public interest; and with the broad range of business, individual, 

              academic, and non-commercial users of the Internet;</p>

            <p>(v). Persons who are willing to serve as volunteers, without compensation 

              other than the reimbursement of certain expenses; and</p>

            <p>(vi) Persons who are able to work and communicate in written and 

              spoken English.&quot; [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-3">Bylaws

            Positions</i></p>

          <p>The criteria for selection of the GNSO Council and At Large Advisory 

            Committee members are less specifically defined in the Bylaws, but 

            the NomCom notes the "Legislative History" behind the decision for 

            NomCom to select some individuals to the above committees. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/evol-reform/blueprint-20jun02.htm">ICANN: 

            A Blueprint for Reform, Section 3</a> (20 June 2002) and <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/committees/evol-reform/final-implementation-report-02oct02.pdf">Final 

            Implementation Report and Recommendations, Section 3(C)</a> (2 October 

            2002)]</p>

          <p>NomCom is looking for women and men who have demonstrated the maturity, 

            experience, knowledge and skills to handle the tasks and make the 

            judgments involved in fulfilling the roles of Board Directors, GNSO 

            Council Members and Interim ALAC Members.</p>

          <blockquote> 

            <p><a name="C8ci"></a>(i) Additional Considerations for the GNSO Council 

              Positions</p>

            <p>For the GNSO Council positions, specific experience related to 

              the scope of GNSO's work with the Domain Name System would be advantageous, 

              whereas Country-Code TLD (ccTLD) and Regional Internet Registry 

              (RIR) familiarity would be less important for these positions.</p>

            <p><a name="C8cii" id="C8cii"></a>(ii) Additional Considerations for 

              the Interim ALAC Positions</p>

            <p>For the Interim ALAC positions, experience and skills that bear 

              on gathering, understanding, and communicating the interests of 

              individual users would be advantageous. Perspectives not otherwise 

              reflected in the existing Interim ALAC membership would be advantageous. 

              NomCom's selections for Interim ALAC are intended to diversify the 

              skill and experience sets of the Interim ALAC, including in such 

              areas as group decision-making. Over time these NomCom selections 

              present an opportunity to connect with the interests of individual 

              users from all categories.</p>

            <p>(i). NomCom shall seek to ensure that the ICANN Board is composed 

              of members who in the aggregate display diversity in geography, 

              culture, skills, experience, and perspective, by applying the criteria 

              set forth above in this document. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-2.2">Bylaws 

              Article VI, Section 2(2)</a>]</p>

            <p>(ii). At no time shall the NomCom select a Director to fill any 

              vacancy or expired term whose selection would cause the total number 

              of Directors (not including the President) who are citizens of countries 

              in any one Geographic Region to exceed five; and the NomCom shall 

              ensure through its selections that at all times the Board includes 

              at least one Director who is a citizen of a country in each ICANN 

              Geographic Region. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-2.2">Bylaws

            <p>(iii) No official of a national government or a multinational entity 

              established by treaty or other agreement between national governments 

              may serve as a Director. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-4.1">Bylaws 

              Article VI, Section 4.1</a>]</p>

              on any Supporting Organization Council shall simultaneously serve 

              as a Director or liaison to the Board. [Details on this restriction

              Directors except Linda Wilson are eligible for selection in 2003, 

              since none of them has exceeded the three term limit as defined 

              in the Bylaws. Wong and Wilson are ineligible in 2003 by reason 

              of their service on the NomCom. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-25mar03.htm#VI-8.5">Bylaws

        <p><b><a name="C10"></a>10. Review and Evaluation of Candidates</b></p>

        <p>For the 2003 Nominating Committee process please see the <a href="/formal-call-05apr03.htm">Formal 

          Call for Recommendations and Statements of Interest</a> posted on the 

          NomCom webpage.</p>

        <p>For full consideration to be given to a Candidate, a completed Statement 

          of Interest must be received by NomCom no later than 5 May 2003.</p>

        <p>NomCom reserves the right to consider Statements of Interest received 

          after May 5, 2003, but makes no commitment to do so.</p>

        <p>NomCom expects to complete its selection of Nominees for all of the 

          positions it is charged to fill in 2003 in time for those selected to 

          be seated at the conclusion of the <a href="http://www.icann.org/montreal/">Montreal ICANN 

          meeting June 22-26, 2003</a>, but reserves the right to adjust its schedule. 

          Adjustments in NomCom's schedule will be posted on its webpage and to 

          subscribers to &lt;<a href="mailot:nomcom.announce-request@icann.org">nomcom.announce-request@icann.org</a>&gt;.</p>

        <p>NomCom will begin its review of Candidate information contained in 

          the completed Statement of Interest as soon as it is received and confirmed 

          to have all required information.</p>

        <p>The NomCom will evaluate Candidates in a fair and consistent manner, 

          considering the Statement of Interest, references, interviews, consultations, 

          and third-party information sources. While doing so, it will adhere 

          to <a href="#A">its Code of Ethics</a>.</p>

        <p>See also <a href="#C8">Section 8 above</a> which describes the criteria 

          and additional considerations that will be taken into account in NomCom's 

          selections. <a href="#C9">Section 9</a> describes the eligibility factors.</p>

        <p>Note that endorsements by organizations or groups and lists of signatories 

          are not appropriate for this NomCom process, and they will not be influential 

          in NomCom's selections since popularity is not one of the criteria being 

          used.</p>

        <p>NomCom will need to carry out due diligence regarding candidates it 

          wishes to consider in the final round of review. For this purpose NomCom 

          will arrange, with consent of these candidates, to conduct confidential 

          references and credential verification and consult with others, not 

          named by the Candidate, on a confidential basis.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that this Nominating Committee process differs from 

          an election, although the goal is the same: to elicit the Internet community's 

          participation in a thoughtful process leading to the selection of very 

          well-qualified individuals to fulfill the specific roles of their positions.</p>
