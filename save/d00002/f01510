<h2>Voices from Seniors</h2>

<h3>Julien Beaudaux (Year 2012)</h3>
<div class="imageAndText1">
  <p class="imageArea"><img src="./image/Beaudaux2012.png" />
  </p>
  <p class="textArea">I spent most of summer 2012 as an intern at IIJ
    Innovation Institute, where I worked on a privacy-aware
    distributed storage system called Tamias. This experience was,
    from my point of view, excellent and successful in a multitude of
    ways. First, every administrative task (finding a flat, receiving
    allowance, etc.) was taken care of from the very beginning. Also,
    everyone at the lab was very nice, so it was easy to get to know
    each other, ask questions and share experiences. The research
    context provided by the lab was a big plus too. The seminars
    organized regularly really helped to know the research topic of
    everyone and get feedback or help. Last but not least, the
    research topics at IIJ II are really vast, so anyone can find a
    topic that fits and fascinate him. This was my case, and I had a
    unique and unforgettable experience. I warmly recommend anyone
    willing to find an internship for the summer to apply at IIJ!

<h3>Nam Dang (2012年)</h3>
<div class="imageAndText1">
  <p class="imageArea"><img src="./image/Dang2012.png" />
  </p>
  <p class="textArea">Experiencing an industry-oriented environment
    was very helpful in seeing the connection between industry-focused
    research and the academic-oriented approaches.
    The staff at IIJ are a great bunch: supportive, fun, open-minded
    and with a variety of background and experiences.
    Most of the time each of us have our own work, but lunch
    time is always a great time when I can get my mind off the task and
    listen to other people's stories. I also had the luck to go on a
    business trip to StarBED, a data center in Ishikawa prefecture. This
    was my first time to experience working on a such large scale projects
    with a hundred machines, and I do believe that this experience will be
    of great use for me in the future.
    Overall, it was both a great challenge and a huge inspiring
    experience. I am now back to my research topic but the internship
    program has provided me with not only practical experience but also
    new perspectives, which I can use for my future work.

<h3>Andra Lutu (2012年)</h3>
<div class="imageAndText1">
  <p class="imageArea"><img src="./image/Lutu2012.png" />
  </p>
  <p class="textArea">The IIJ-II summer internship was a great experience,
    that helped improve my research skills by allowing a more grounded
    and close-to-reality approach.  I have enjoyed very much working
    with the people active within the institute, I feel that we had
    a very dynamic interaction and a fruitful collaboration.
    I deeply appreciate the constant support and the continuous
    dialogue (even after the end of the actual internship period)
    that enabled us to answer the research problems we were dealing with.
    Aside from the work-related experience, which I have immensely enjoyed,
    I must say that I am so happy to have had my first contact with
    the Japanese culture while a part of this environment.
    All the people from IIJ tried to make our stay there as comfortable as
    possible. Also, we've had a bit of team building experience
    during the IIJ Summer Lab Camp.  It was a good chance to present
    our work and/or ideas and to learn about the research interests of
    all the rest of the lab members.  And, of course, we had a lot of
    fun enjoying the traditional Japanese ryokan during the camp.
    All in all, those were two intense and amazing months,
    I have enjoyed every minute of it and I only wish it could have
    lasted longer.
