<pre>pkgsrc-2013Q1
=============

The pkgsrc team is proud to announce that pkgsrc-2013Q1 is available.
As usual, this release includes many new packages and updates.

pkgsrc releases take place at the end of every quarter. The
pkgsrc-2013Q1 release is the 50th release of pkgsrc.

To honor this release, we've finally decided on a logo for pkgsrc.
It follows the design by Chris Wareham and Lubomir Sedlacik,
implemented by Dieter Baron. Thank you!

Take a look at it on the pkgsrc wiki: <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pkgsrc.org">http://www.pkgsrc.org</a>

This version adds support for Cygwin. More work to be done, but you
should be able to build some packages already.

This will be the last release supporting ruby-1.8. Please migrate to
ruby-1.9.

About pkgsrc
============

pkgsrc is a framework allowing third-party software to be built,
installed, and managed in a consistent, logical and easy manner. The
framework is portable across operating systems, making it easy to
support diverse systems from Windows to BSD, and including Linux and
Mac OS X - see below for a complete list of platforms.

pkgsrc allows end users or system administrators to build their own
binary packages from source, or to use pre-built binary packages that
were themselves built from source using the pkgsrc framework. The
resulting binary packages can be downloaded if necessary, installed,
and manipulated using simple tools provided with pkgsrc, or using more
sophisticated binary package managers such as pkgin and nih.

The pkgsrc project distributes the framework that can be used to build
packages on all the supported platforms. The project also distributes
binary packages for a few of the supported platforms. Third parties
may distribute binary packages for some platforms.

At the present time, pkgsrc supports 20 platforms:

        AIX
        BSDOS
        Cygwin
        Darwin/Mac OS X
        DragonFly
        FreeBSD
        FreeMiNT
        Haiku
        HPUX
        Interix/SFU/SUA
        IRIX
        Linux
        Minix3
        MirBSD
        NetBSD
        OpenBSD
        OSF1
        QNX
        SunOS/Solaris/SmartOS
        UnixWare

Numbers of Packages
===================

The total number of packages provided by pkgsrc-2013Q1 is:

12111 total pkgsrc entries
181 packages have been added this quarter
60 packages have been removed this quarter
1270 packages have been updated this quarter
1 package has been renamed this quarter
1 package has been moved this quarter

The latest figures we have for available binary packages are:

11141 binary packages built with gcc for NetBSD-5.1/i386
11660 binary packages built with clang for NetBSD-current/amd64
11105 binary packages for Dragonfly-3.3/i386
10595 binary packages for Linux-3.2.7/x86_64
 9888 binary packages for SunOS-5.11/i386
 9840 binary packages for SunOS-5.11/x86_64

These numbers may not compare exactly to other (binary) packaging
systems; some packaging systems split large packages like boost up
into multiple packages, while others keep unused and unbuildable
packages.

Changes this quarter
====================

A large amount of work has been done this quarter to building packages
on different platforms with newer compilers.

The default version of the PHP language was raised to 5.4.

The default version for MySQL was also raised, to 5.5.

ghostscript was split into two packages: ghostscript-gpl (the older
version, available under the GPL) and ghostscript-agpl (the current
version, available under the AGPL) since the AGPL is not in the
default-allowed licenses for pkgsrc.

transmission-gui was split in two packages, transmission-gtk and
transmission-qt.

New packages include R-intervals, ansible, autoconf-archive, bwping,
cantarell-fonts, compat packages for NetBSD 5.0, 5.1, and 6.0
consolamono-ttf, courier-prime, cvsps3, a few deforaos packages, dhex,
di, docx2txt, eigen3, electrix, euca2ools, firefox17,
gimp-high-pass-filter, google-glog, gxmessage, gyp, i3, ibniz,
ibus-mozc, icinga-base, ipv6-toolkit, isl, java-rxtx, jsMath-fonts,
kyua-testers, labelnation, libexecinfo, libint, libnetpgpverify,
libsodium, libuv, log2timeline, lua-lpeg, lxsession, menu-cache, mimp,
minimalist, mozc-elisp, mozc-server, mozc-tool, mpqc, mysql-5.6
packages, nagios-plugin-dumpdates, nagios-plugin-raidctl,
netpgpverify, nginx-devel, nss-pgsql, open-vcdiff, openvpn-nagios,
around 17 perl packages, pam-pgsql, pear-Math_BigInteger, perltidy,
php-pdo_odbc, php-piwigo, php-sugarcrm, php-tt-rss,
php-zendoptimizerplus, py-beets, py-flask, py-tornado, about 26 more
Python packages, qcomicbook, qpdf, qpdfview, rabbiter, reposurgeon,
around 34 ruby packages, se, squid3, stud, subversion16, tex-textcase,
tex-textcase-doc, tktable, toppler, transmission-gtk, transmission-qt,
tweak, uncrustify, uqm, user_cygwin, xdot, zoneminder.

Package of the Quarter
======================

Aleksej Saushev recommends MPI-3 support via MPICH 3 and MPQC for
those interested in quantum chemistry.

OBATA Akio nominates Mozc, a modern Japanese Input Method Editor.

Advantages of pkgsrc
====================

Advantages of using pkgsrc rather than either building from source
without using pkgsrc, or installing pre-built binary software without
using pkgsrc, include:

+ not only is the provenance of source code checked (by using multiple
checksums), with pkgsrc, the version of source code you are working
with is the same that other developers and users have.

+ patches are maintained in a central repository, and, again, are
checked at patch application time by using digests. The patches which
are applied to the sources being built are the same ones which are
known to be used and proved by other pkgsrc users (not necessarily on
the same platform)

+ by building from source, all doubts about compilers, build practices
source code cleanliness, and packaging differences are removed.
Digital signatures of binary packages, while useful in themselves,
only prove certain aspects of binary package provenance. (pkgsrc has
had support for signed packages since 2001.)

+ pkgsrc provides a mechanism to install a package for the relevant
operating system or architecture if such a package hasn't been created
by the software vendor or third party or is difficult to find.

+ With pkgsrc, complete dependency and pre-requisite package
information is held and used by the package management software - if
packages rely on other packages to function properly, that
pre-requisite will be built or downloaded if necessary, installed, and
managed as part of the package installation process.

+ local or site options which span packages can be set in a standard
way

+ pkgsrc includes a framework for linking only with pre-requisite
packages which are explicitly named; no &quot;build system package&quot; leakage
can take place
