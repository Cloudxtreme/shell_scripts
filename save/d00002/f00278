<P>
Try Darren Reed's <CODE>ipfilter</CODE>, which is a TCP/IP packet filter. It
can:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>explicitly deny/permit any packet from passing through

<LI>distinguish between various interfaces

<LI>filter by IP networks or hosts

<LI>selectively filter any IP protocol

<LI>selectively filter fragmented IP packets

<LI>selectively filter packets with IP options.

<LI>send back an ICMP error/TCP reset for blocked packets

<LI>keep packet state information for TCP, UDP and ICMP packet flows.

<LI>keep fragment state information for any IP packet, applying the same rule to all fragments.

<LI>act as a Network Address Translator (NAT)

<LI>use redirection to setup true transparent proxy connections.

</UL>

<P>
Special provision is made for the three most common Internet protocols,
TCP, UDP and ICMP. The IP Packet filter allows filtering of:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>TCP/UDP packets by port number or a port number range

<LI>ICMP packets by type/code

<LI>"established" TCP packets

<LI>on any arbitary combination of TCP flags

<LI>"short" (fragmented) IP packets with incomplete headers can be filtered

<LI>any of the 19 IP options or 8 registered IP security  classes

<LI>TOS (Type of Service) field in packets

</UL>

<P>

</P>
<P>
If setting up a whole packet filter seems overkill to you, there's a
package called tcp_wrapper, which you can put in your <TT>`/etc/inetd.conf'</TT>
and which will only allow/deny certain services based on a pser host/user 
basis. The package is available under
<A HREF="ftp://cert.org/pub/tools/tcp_wrappers/">ftp://cert.org/pub/tools/tcp_wrappers/</A>.
