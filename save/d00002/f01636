<h2><a name="Letter">Letter From the President</a></h2>
<h3>
  <p>From Apprentice to Non-Profit</p>
  <p>The Making of The FreeBSD Foundation</p>
</h3>

<p>
My first introduction to FreeBSD came in the form of a tall, wirery,
figure, camped out in the Walnut Creek CDROM machine room.  Rod
Grimes cut the figure of a true hacker: skin only touched by the
rays of a glowing CRT, nicotine stains on his long fingers toned
by hours of vi keywork, and a wardrobe comprised of faded blue jeans
and worn out t-shirts.  Regardless of what hours I worked during
my internship that summer of 1993, Rod was always awake, hunched
over his keyboard, putting all of his energy into the first ever
release of FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
I was between my second and third years working on an undergraduate
degree at the University of California at Berkeley.  Even attending
the institute of BSD's genesis, I was completely unaware of Berkeley's
contributions to UNIX.  So it was really a stroke of luck, a random
choice to take a job organizing OS/2 software into a CDROM distribution,
that led me to Walnut Creek that summer to witness the making of
FreeBSD 1.0.  But without Rod's passion and dedication, I doubt I'd
have realized the opportunity before me.
</p>

<p>
What I quickly learned from watching Rod and then delving into
FreeBSD, was the incompleteness of my education from Berkeley.  Sure
I was technically proficient in computer algorithms and writing
code, but my courses failed to give me a sense of the art of computer
engineering: how to be a craftsman practicing my trade, how to
design and build a complex system that is robust and maintainable,
and how to collaborate successfully in such a system.  The structure
and methodology behind FreeBSD made it the perfect vehicle for
absorbing the real world skills of being a successful programmer.
</p>

<p>
In 1993, the development model used by the BSDs was rarely encountered
in open source projects: revision control, a bug tracking database,
a coding style standard, the hardening of software through peer
review and discussion, and a governing body to mediate write access
to the code and to resolve disputes.  Many of these pillars of
professional and successful engineering are lacking in both corporate
and open source environments today.  In fact, it took almost a
decade for BSD's main competitor Linux to catch up and adopt something
as fundamental as revision control.  In so many ways, FreeBSD's
development model was superior and ahead of the times.
</p>

<p>
So I started my second education while completing my first.  During
my last two years at Berkeley I spent most of my free time, and
some time I should have devoted to the classes for my degree,
absorbing the lessons FreeBSD had to teach.  The FreeBSD distribution
offered practical examples of how to deal with almost any type of
computer science challenge - examples that I found much more
compelling than the contrived exercises in my text books.  While I
was learning I was also able to contribute in small ways.  The
reviews of my work were much more useful than for the projects
associated with my formal studies.  The feedback wasn't always
delivered in the most pleasant way, but that in itself provided
valuable experience on how to improve my people skills.
</p>

<p>
Small contributions lead to larger ones.  The apprentice became a
mentor.  Upon receiving my degree, I found myself sitting on FreeBSD's
governing body, the FreeBSD Core Team, with a skill set and experience
in high demand and not found in other members of my graduating
class.
</p>

<p>
The historical way to contribute back to the FreeBSD project has
always been to volunteer time to enhance the "product" that is
FreeBSD.  For seven years this was the primary way I repaid FreeBSD
for the valuable education I received by being part of its community.
However, by 2000 I was struggling to find a better way to ensure
the continued success of FreeBSD.  FreeBSD's mindshare growth was
slowing.  Linux was starting to receive the attention and financial
backing of large corporations.  I wanted to create something that
could promote, protect, and grow the use of FreeBSD even while the
duties of my paid day job prevented me from personally achieving
that mission.  The natural answer was to form a corporation.
</p>

<p>
This had been done before.  Jordan Hubbard was operating FreeBSD
Inc., but its charter and activities were never well defined.  I
wanted to build an entity that engendered the trust of the FreeBSD
community, followed in the Open Source spirit of doing good for
good's sake, yet could perform tasks only possible with a legal
corporate entity.  The FreeBSD Foundation, an open-book, 501(c)3
U.S. non-profit charity, was born.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward a little over a decade, and the FreeBSD Foundation
still adheres to the same mission I defined for it in 2000.  Every
year we sponsor BSD conferences and events around the globe, work
to protect the intellectual property of the FreeBSD project, visit
institutions and corporations to promote the use of FreeBSD, and
fund research and development projects that enhance the FreeBSD OS.
But even with our $400,000 annual budget there are so many things
we want to do, but can't.  Just as was the case for me in 2000, the
FreeBSD Foundation is searching today for new ways to help support
the FreeBSD project.
</p>

<p>
In the coming months you will see one of the ways the FreeBSD
Foundation is changing.  Using the feedback we have gleaned from
countless meetings with FreeBSD consumers both large and small, the
FreeBSD Foundation is sponsoring the work to fully specify and
estimate the cost of implementing critical enhancements to the
FreeBSD platform.  Developed in partnership with the FreeBSD
community, the goal of this effort is to provide a roadmap for
infrastructure improvements that have long been needed, but have
gone unsatisfied due to lack of a coherent direction.  This model
will also give current and potential supporters of the FreeBSD
Foundation concrete insight into our future plans.
</p>

<p>
I can't imagine what my life would be like today without my FreeBSD
experience.  Through the FreeBSD Foundation I hope to give back to
the FreeBSD community even more than I have received, and help to
ensure that the next young engineer has the same opportunities as
I did.  However the FreeBSD Foundation can't do it alone.  If FreeBSD
has impacted your life, please visit our <a href="http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/">

<h2><a name="Fundraising">Fundraising Update</a></h2>
<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation has been proudly supporting the FreeBSD
Project and community for 11 years now. Every year we sponsor BSD
conferences and events around the globe, help developers with their
travel expenses to attend these conferences, work to protect the
intellectual property of the FreeBSD project, visit institutions
and corporations to promote the use of FreeBSD, purchase equipment
to grow the FreeBSD project's infrastructure, and fund research and
development projects that enhance the FreeBSD OS.
</p>

<p>
For 2011, we set a fundraising goal of $400,000 with a spending
budget of $350,000.  As of this publication we have raised $210,000.
By this time last year, we had raised $195,000, but ended the year
raising a total of $325,000. We are hoping that you, the FreeBSD
community, will help us finish the year strong by making a donation
this month.
</p>

<p>
In this newsletter you will have the opportunity to see just some
of the places where your donation dollars are going:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  $100,000 in completed development projects with several other projects
  approved or in our pipeline.
  </li>
  <li>
  $41,000 in travel grants and conference sponsorships. 
  </li>
  <li>
  $45,000 in equipment for maintaining and improving the infrastructure
  that supports our community.
  </li>
 </ul>

<p>
We hope that when you finish reading the newsletter, you will have
a good understanding of the impact your donations to the Foundation
have on the Project.
</p>

<p>
And the FreeBSD Foundation is hard at work to expand our reach and
to do even more with the money you give.  Based on your feedback,
we will be growing our funded development work while giving you,
the donor, more insight into the projects we plan to fund.  Starting
in 2012, the FreeBSD Foundation will be sponsoring project proposal
development so that the community can discuss, agree on, and help
raise funds for, critical improvements to the FreeBSD OS.  These
projects, their full specifications and estimated cost, will be
available on our website for anyone to review.  Be sure to visit
our website in the new year to see these projects develop and to
lend a hand in their completion.
</p>

<p>
While reading about the FreeBSD Foundation's achievements in our newsletter, 
please consider the value that FreeBSD represents to you. Know that 
<a href="/donate/">donating
to the FreeBSD Foundation</a> is the most cost effective way you can ensure the 
future of FreeBSD. With your help, we look forward to not only meeting our 
fundraising goal, but increasing our investment in FreeBSD for 2012.

<p>
<h3><a name="Project2">Feed-Forward Clock Synchronization Algorithms Project</a></h3>
</p>

<p>
Everyone, and most everything, needs a clock, and computers 
are no exception. Clocks tend to drift off if left to themselves, 
however, so it is necessary to bring them to heel periodically 
through synchronizing to some other reference clock of higher 
accuracy. An inexpensive and convenient way to do this is over 
a computer network.
</p>

<p>
More than 25 years ago, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
Request for Comments (RFC) 956, 957, and 958 defined
what is now commonly known as the Network Time 
Protocol (NTP), and its associated feedback based algorithm 
embodied in the ntpd daemon. For many years it has been 
the only option available, but now the RADclock, a 
feed-forward alternative, has been developed.
</p>

<p>
With the support for feed-forward clock synchronization 
being merged into CURRENT, December 2011 marks the end 
of an era. The ntpd daemon is not alone anymore and new 
synchronization alternatives can be designed, implemented 
and tested.

<p>
The feed-forward clock support is currently available 
as a kernel option (FFCLOCK). Once enabled, it allows 
the ntpd and radclock daemons to run concurrently and 
let the administrator choose which of the two will 
adjust the system clock.  The use of a feed-forward 
clock is then transparent to all consumers of time 
within the kernel and all user space applications.
</p>

<p>
The FFCLOCK support also provides a richer clock API. 
An important new dimension is the availability of the 
"difference clock." With the radclock providing reliable 
estimates of the frequency of the underlying hardware 
counter, this API provides ways to measure a small interval 
of time extremely accurately, virtually free of any errors 
in clock drift estimates. The BPF subsystem has also been 
modified to allow clock selection on a per BPF device basis. 
For example, this feature allows a smooth transition to 
radclock, letting ntpd adjust the system clock, while 
experimenting with the radclock to measure network 
performance metrics or code execution time.
</p>

<p>
Why should the FreeBSD community care about feed-forward 
and new clock synchronization support?  We believe that 
many new applications can benefit from a feed-forward 
clock such as RADclock, which has shown to be a more 
accurate, and more importantly, more robust clock than 
the ntpd daemon.  Both generic and specialized clock 
synchronization components can be installed to best 
suit requirements, be it a network monitoring probe or
a cluster node supporting virtual machines, absolute 
time versus time differences, or the collection of raw 
timing data enabling final timestamps to be (re)created 
and corrected/enhanced in post-processing. The radclock 
daemon has been designed to cover most uses and is a 
first implementation of a feed-forward clock algorithm.
</p>

<p>
No clock is perfect. The FFCLOCK support provides functions 
that help compare two running clocks cleanly on the same event 
and can help diagnose problems. The specialized clock and 
clock comparison tools, used to be the domain of experts, 
but are now available to all. We hope this will encourage 
the community to try the FFCLOCK support and the radclock 
daemon, provide feedback, and improve and polish the 
feed-forward approach.
</p>

<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation is sponsoring Julien Ridoux and Darryl 
Veitch at the University of Melbourne to bring the feed-forward 
support to FreeBSD. The feed-forward has been merged in CURRENT 
and will be MFC'ed into STABLE thanks to Lawrence Stewart. 
</p>

synchronization can be found on ACM Queue:

<h3><a name="Project3">Implementing xlocale APIs to Enable Porting libc++</a></h3>
</p>

<p>
One of the goals for FreeBSD 10 is to be completely free of GPL'd
code in the base system.  This is no small undertaking.  FreeBSD
has shipped the GNU C and C++ compilers, and the GNU C++ standard
library, for a long time.  Unfortunately, the license change to
GPLv3 upstream means that we are currently shipping a C++ toolchain
from 2007.
</p>

<p>
There are three major components to a C++ implementation.  These
are the compiler, the standard template library (STL) implementation,
and the ABI library.  The compiler turns the C++ source code into
assembly or object code and inserts calls into the ABI library for
various dynamic features, such as exception handling, run-time type
information, and so on.  The source code typically references things
in the STL implementation directly.  These are the parts of the
stack that are specific to C++, there are others, such as the linker,
the generic unwind library and C standard library, that are required
by C++ but are also used by other languages.
</p>

<p>
In FreeBSD, these parts have traditionally been g++, libstdc++, and
libsupc++, all of which come from the GNU project.  In recent
releases, clang has been imported as an alternative to g++, but
that still leaves the standard libraries.
</p>

<p>
Recently, the LLVM project has provided libc++ as a replacement for
libstdc++ on Darwin.  Apple ships both libstdc++ and libc++ with
OS X 10.7.  This provides a good alternative to libstdc++, but it
had one major limitation: it only worked on Darwin.  The main issue
with porting it to FreeBSD was the lack of Darwin's xlocale APIs
in libc.  These are variants of all of the locale-aware standard C
functions, which take the locale as an explicit parameter.
</p>

<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation sponsored me to implement the xlocale APIs
for FreeBSD.  This work is complete and the code is now in -CURRENT.
Along with the NetBSD Foundation, the FreeBSD Foundation also paid
for libcxxrt, an implementation of the ABI layer that I wrote for
PathScale, to be released under a BSD license.
</p>

<p>
I have just finished importing libcxxrt and libc++ into -CURRENT.
They are not built by default yet, because libc++ is written in
C++11 and so can't be built with the old version of g++ that we
include (although it can be built with the version of clang that
we ship).  If you want to try them, then you need to enable building
with clang and add MK_LIBCPLUSPLUS=yes to your /etc/make.conf.
Alternatively, just check out head and do make and make install in
lib/libcxxrt and then lib/libc++ - make sure that CXX is set to
clang++, or libc++ will fail to build.
</p>

<p>
If you want to try it, then after building and installing it just
add -stdlib=libc++ to your clang++ command line, for both compiling
and linking.  This will select the correct set of headers and link
the correct library.
</p>

<p>
I hope to include libc++ as a preview release in FreeBSD 9.1.  It
probably won't be used for anything in the base system then, but
it will let people test their C++ code with the new stack in
preparation for FreeBSD 10, which, all being well, won't ship with
the GNU stack at all (although you'll still be able to get it from
ports).

<h3><a name="Project4">DIFFUSE for FreeBSD</a></h3>
</p>
<p>
DIFFUSE (Distributed Firewall and Flow-shaper Using Statistical
Evidence) is an extension to the FreeBSD IPFW firewall subsystem
developed by the Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures, Swinburne
University of Technology. It allows IPFW to classify network traffic
in near real-time based on statistical properties of packet flows,
and instantiate network actions across a distributed set of "action
nodes" for particular flows if required.
</p>

<p>
DIFFUSE offers a compelling set of features for the FreeBSD community
to use and innovate upon, and we thank the FreeBSD Foundation for
helping to bring DIFFUSE to FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
At its core, DIFFUSE's design seeks to give network architects and
administrators a flexible architecture with which to decouple flow
classification/identification from flow treatment. Having one or
more classifier nodes control many action nodes in near real-time
opens up many possibilities for network traffic management, shaping,
policy deployment and provisioning quality of service.
</p>

<p>
Using machine learning techniques and network traffic class models,
the DIFFUSE classifier can classify traffic flows in near real-time,
needing only a handful of packets in order to make an initial
classification, followed by periodic re-classification throughout
a flow's lifetime. Developing traffic class models is straight
forward using the available tools and documentation. In time, it
is also hoped a community repository of useful models will be
established.
</p>

<p>
By extending IPFW's grammar, DIFFUSE allows users to define firewall
rules in terms of higher levels of abstraction e.g. a rule can be
written to match and prioritise all packets on a set of action nodes
which the classifier identifies as belonging to the Skype class.
Rules can also be expressed in terms of statistical flow features
like average packet length, interarrival time, and size.
</p>

<p>
Statistical flow features are particularly useful for identifying
port-nimble applications and in environments where packet inspection
is not possible (e.g.  encryption) or prohibitively expensive. Their
use as the basis for DIFFUSE's capabilities can improve the robustness
of a firewall rule set because of the higher abstraction used to
specify rules.
</p>

<p>
The code is currently available in the "diffused_head" project
branch of the FreeBSD Subversion repository, and will be merged to
the head branch (10-CURRENT) soon. Any questions should be directed
to Lawrence Stewart (lstewart@FreeBSD.org).
</p>

<p>
Development of the DIFFUSE prototype was made possible in part by
a gift from The Cisco University Research Program Fund, a corporate
advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Many thanks
also go to the project's technical monitor, Bj&#246rn Zeeb, for reviewing
the code and providing excellent feedback.

<!-- Conferences and Travel Grants -->
<h2><a name="Conferences">Conference Updates</a></h2>
<h3><a name="EuroBSDCon">EuroBSDCon 2011</a></h3>

<p>
EuroBSDcon is the European technical conference for people working
on and with 4.4BSD based operating systems and related projects.
This conference is held in a different European country each year.
In October 2011 the 10th EuroBSDcon was held in Maarssen, The
Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
We were pleased we were able to make this 10th EuroBSDcon a real
celebration by having anniversary cakes, 'poffertjes' (A sort of
special dutch small pancake), and ice cream for all the visitors.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, EuroBSDcon has a strong FreeBSD presence, but there
is also enough room for the other BSD's. One of the reasons for the
strong FreeBSD presence is the FreeBSD devsummit, which is held
parallel to the tutorial days of EuroBSDcon.
</p>

<p>
During the organization of EuroBSDcon we learned that travel costs
of speakers can really put a strain on the budget. Fortunately for
our sponsors, among others, The FreeBSD Foundation, we were able
to invite a lot more speakers than would have been possible otherwise.
And this in turn lead to a better program with more topics for the
visitors to choose from.
</p>

<p>
Besides sponsoring, The FreeBSD Foundation also provides travel
grants for visitors and developers who can not afford to go the
conference on their own. This gives them the opportunity to visit
the conference and exchange knowledge and ideas with other conference
attendees.
</p>

<p>
Now that the conference is over, work is being done to start a
EuroBSDcon Foundation to help with organizing EuroBSDcons in the
coming years. We plan on announcing next year's location very soon.

<h3><a name="KyivBSD">KievBSD 2011</a></h3>

<p>
This year the KyivBSD conference took place at a local university,
with plenty of seating.  We had around 70 FreeBSD enthusiasts who
attended our conference!
</p>

<p>
This was first year that we tried to separate talks by their general
theme - so we had a hardware section and a software section. This
was also the first year that we accepted English language talks,
and we invited folks from Europe to participate. Talks covered such
interesting topics as Intel GEM, Embedded FreeBSD, Enclosure
management in FreeBSD, also the IPV6 present state, OS Updating, and
general problems of project. The FreeBSD community is growing stronger
because of conferences like this. This conference also helps get new
people interested in FreeBSD. And it helped raise questions and 
discussions about some of the project's problems, like old package s
ystem and update issues.
</p>

<p>
Every visitor received a packet with free items - the packet itself
with conference logo, T-shirt, pen, notepad (the real paper one),
and everyone who wanted to support FreeBSD could buy some beautifully
designed posters.  Some of these posters also went to EuroBSDCon.
</p>

<p>
Here's a story about something funny that happened in the talk about
ipv6. The speaker said that "in the future, there will be no Broadcom
at all!," listeners were puzzled, but silently continued listening
to the speaker. When he repeated, "No Broadcom ever!,"  and someone
said "Maybe broadcasts? There will be no more broadcasts?," everyone
laughed. Of course, he meant broadcasts!  Long live Broadcom!!
</p>

<p>
The main sponsor of this year's conference (and all past years'
too) was The FreeBSD Foundation. The foundation kindly and generously
helps fund this event. From our side, we dedicate a part of the
introduction talk to them and we make a small presentation about
foundation goals and needs.  This is really an important part of
the conference, since not many of our attendees know what the
foundation does and why they need donations. In kib@'s talk everyone
saw how important and difficult the GEM driver was, which was funded
by the foundation. Anyway, attendees were willingly and happily
buying overpriced "free" stuff, to help the foundation.

<h3><a name="VendorSummit">SF Bay Area Vendor Summit, November 2011</a></h3>

<p>
On November 3rd and 4th the FreeBSD Project held its second Vendor
Summit, sponsored by NetApp and The FreeBSD Foundation.  The summit
was held on the NetApp campus in Silicon Valley California and
encompassed one day of focused discussions and a half day of
tutorials.  The Foundation provided us with financial backing and
support without which we could not have held the summit.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the summits is to bring vendors together with members
of the project to help focus on areas that might not normally be
addressed by the general development community.  They're also a
vehicle for getting vendors to contribute code that is not specific
to their products and which can greatly help FreeBSD to evolve and
grow over time.
</p>

<p>
In all, a group of 60 people attended the meetings, and 30 of them
took one of the two tutorials that were offered.  The attendees
were drawn from the FreeBSD project as well as engineers and managers
representing vendors who use FreeBSD in their projects.
</p>

<p>
The first day was a series of meetings where the attendees tried
to address two questions: 1) What technologies did vendors need
from the FreeBSD project?  2) What code could the vendors share
with the project?  A special section also addressed the project's
virtualization strategy.  The meetings generated lists of requests
as well as possible contributions that were collected into a
comprehensive set of notes which have now been shared with all the
attendees.
</p>

<p>
On the second day John Baldwin taught a tutorial on developing
drivers for FreeBSD and Kirk McKusick gave a tutorial about filesystems
technology in the operating system.  Both tutorials were well
attended and well received.
</p>

<p>
These meetings will now occur twice a year, once at BSDCan, and in
the Fall in Silicon Valley.

<h2><a name="Grants">2011 Grant and Travel Grant Recipients</a></h2>
<p>
Every year we sponsor FreeBSD related conferences, and travel to
these events for FreeBSD contributors.  We believe that BSD-centered
and FreeBSD-specific conferences play the dual roles of expanding
the FreeBSD user community and supporting collaborative development.
The FreeBSD Foundation's travel grant program helps to reduce
financial roadblocks to participation in these events.
</p>

</p>
Our grant recipients often send us amazing tales of their experiences,
proving the value of this program to the FreeBSD community.  Below
are three of their stories.
</p>

<p><i>contributed by Benedict Reuschling</i></p>

<p>
The months leading up to a BSD conference like EuroBSDCon is an
exiting time.  These conferences provide an excellent opportunity
to get to know the FreeBSD people behind their email addresses and
IRC nicks, to discuss issues face to face with each other, and to
have a good time with people who share the same passion.  EuroBSDCon
2011 was to be held in Maarssen, Netherlands and community members
talked actively on IRC about whether or not they would attend. For
most people who go to these conferences regularly, it's relatively
easy to save some money beforehand. But, for those who are new to
the project, it can be a problem.  Especially if, like students
attending a university, they do not yet have a regular income.
</p>

<p>
One such student, Niclas Zeising, runs a FreeBSD mirror server in
Sweden.  Sweden apparently does not have many BSD users - we currently
have only one committer from Sweden!  Niclas has been a FreeBSD
user longer than I have been and has in recent years started to
submit patches to our FreeBSD documentation set. One day we were
talking on IRC about various things when the topic of EuroBSDCon
came up.  I told him what a wonderful time I had at last year's
EuroBSDCon, which was my first BSD conference ever, and that I was
planning to attend this one as well. Niclas was interested in meeting
the people behind the FreeBSD project and had the time to spend a
week away from his university courses.  However, he was a bit
reluctant.  Niclas had recently invested money in and moved to a
new apartment.  He said that he probably could afford the student
prices for the conference as well as his flight, dinners, and other
expenses, but that the hotel price was too expensive for him (even
with the special rate that the conference organizers had negotiated).
Niclas knew about the FreeBSD Foundation travel grant program.  The
concern was that, since Niclas was not a committer yet, he would
have a lower priority for sponsorship.  If he submitted a grant
request, would it be approved?
</p>

<p>
By that time, I had already booked my room and knew the total price
for it. I thought, "If the price of a hotel room is the only thing
standing in Niclas' way of getting to meet BSD people in person,
this should not prevent him from going to EuroBSDCon." Also, I was
curious to get to know him, too. So I offered to pay for his hotel
room and we struck a deal: I would submit a travel grant request
to the FreeBSD Foundation to pay me back his hotel costs if he
agreed to write a trip report about his experiences afterwards. As
a bonus, I invited him to the developer summit that took place two
days before the conference. I would not have done this for a random
stranger on the Internet, but Niclas already had a small track
record of work within the FreeBSD Project.  This could prove to be
a good investment toward a future committer.  Niclas happily agreed
and we went through with the plan.
</p>

<p>
I'm very sure Niclas enjoyed the whole experience. A bit shy at
first, because he did not know anyone yet, I introduced him to the
people I already knew from my last European BSD conference. On the
first dinner prior to the developer summit, we were lucky to sit
at the same table where Kirk McKusick and Eric Allman were.  We had
very nice conversations during the evening.  What a great introduction
to the BSD community and the nice people that are part of it!
</p>

<p>
Over the next few days, Niclas spent much time talking to various
members of the BSD community.  During breaks, at dinners, and in
the hacking lounges, he was even getting to know some people I had
not yet met!  It was very interesting to see him having a good time
and getting to know the people who were there.  It reminded me of
my first time among the BSD folk who, in my experience, are very
welcoming to newcomers.
</p>

<p>
When it was time to leave, Niclas was very grateful.  He told me
that if ever I visited Sweden, he would be glad to give me a tour.
Clearly, a big win for me as well!
</p>

<p>
The FreeBSD Foundation did reimburse me for Niclas' hotel costs,
but even without their sponsorship, I would still have done it.
After the conference, our conversations have intensified and Niclas
is even more excited about FreeBSD.  We are now working on making him
a FreeBSD doc committer.  What a great experience for both of us
and great way to grow our community!
</p>

<p>The Success Story of a Certain FreeBSD Writer</p>

<p><i>contributed by Daichi GOTO &ltdaichi@freebsd.org&gt</i></p>

<p>
In recent years, you may have seen the "Asian FreeBSD Dynamic Duo."
Like fish out of water, finding them at BSDCan, EuroBSDCon and
FreeBSD DevSummits is very easy.  They always stick out like a sore
thumb in a group of world citizens.  One of them is the famous, and
my respected committer, hrs.  The other is me, Daichi, one of
the developers that reimplemented unionfs.
</p>

<p>
The reason why I attend these conferences and summits frequently
is to obtain the latest FreeBSD information and to pick up on the
subtle nuances of FreeBSD happenings for the population living on
a certain large four islands, Japan.
</p>

<p>
I am Japanese, so I don't know if it's my place to say this...
Japanese are relatively earnest and skillful.  I know many good
developers, fluent in many different programming languages.
However, they have one major downside.  Most of them share a
difficulty with a particular language. That language is very hard
to learn - harder than C/C++ and other popular programming languages.
Most of them failed to master this language. That language is
English.
</p>

<p>
Improving my English skills is one big reason why I attend these
conferences every year.  One of my jobs is as a technical writer.
I know the power of FreeBSD and I translate that power into Japanese
for developers and users every day.
</p>

<p>
I use English to communicate in email, on mailing lists, and forums.
Actually I am writing in English right now, but it's not my strong
suit.  I'm always concerned about whether or not I have understood
correctly. That's why I believe it's so important for me to travel
to BSD conferences and exchange information.
</p>

<p>
My precious ability to attend these conferences is
sponsored by FreeBSD Foundation.  I really appreciate it. 
To contribute to the Foundation's support, I'm working very 
hard with some media firms.  I can't give you the specifics 
at this moment. But don't worry!  There will be an amazing 
FreeBSD Christmas present for all developers and users in
Japan. It will happen very soon, so stay tuned!
</p>

<p>
I just wish to say one last time. Thank you again FreeBSD
Foundation for your great support!
</p>

============================================ 

<p><i>contributed by Thomas Abthorpe</i></p>

<p>
I am a ports committer, and the work I do in the ports tree is
purely as a hobbyist.  My day job as a server administrator has
nothing to do with my volunteer work within the FreeBSD Project.
</p>

<p>
That is why I applied for a travel grant from the FreeBSD Foundation.
My employer will not pay for a conference for my volunteer work,
and the family budget can only absorb a finite amount of the cost
of my efforts within the Project.  That is were the Foundation comes
in.  I have been very fortunate to have been sponsored twice to
attend conferences: BSDCan 2009 and 2011.
</p>

<p>
My trip reports are a matter of public record.  By attending these
conferences I have gained valuable experience, connected with
fascinating people that use FreeBSD, learned from presenters and
most importantly, forged some friendships that will last a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
The donations made to the FreeBSD Foundation help to fund development
projects, offset the costs running events like BSDCan, and assist
with the costs of enthusiasts like me.  Without the assistance of
a travel grant, it is  unlikely that I would ever be able to attend
a conference.
</p>

<p>
So please make a donation to the FreeBSD Foundation.  Every little
bit goes a long way in keeping the FreeBSD Project viable.

<h2><a name="RideCharge">RideCharge/TaxiMagic Testimonial</a></h2>

<p>
RideCharge, Inc. creates innovative technology solutions that improve
local ground transportation industries. The company's most renowned
product, Taxi Magic, is an online & mobile software application that
revolutionizes the taxi industry by aligning riders, drivers and fleets
for a better overall ride experience. Taxi Magic is the first nationwide
free online taxi booking service that is directly integrated with taxi
dispatch systems, providing consumers with the tools to:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Book a taxi from a mobile app or the Web with a few quick taps</li>
<li>Track the taxi's arrival</li>
<li>Charge the ride to a credit card through the mobile app</li>
<li>Expense the trip with an e-receipt</li>
</ul>

<p>
From its inception, RideCharge has been entirely based on FreeBSD. By
leveraging FreeBSD Jails for virtualization, we are able to maximize
resources and expand dynamically.  ZFS keeps our data safe and our
deployments magically quick.  Userland DTRACE in FreeBSD 9 is now an
indispensable tool for troubleshooting issues in real-time. Even our
Juniper firewalls and switches leverage FreeBSD through JUNOS (TM).
iXsystems is incredibly helpful in recommending the correct setup and
optimizing our technology resources to fit our needs for FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
RideCharge is a long time contributor to the FreeBSD ports collection
and we employ highly active contributors in the ruby, apache, and perl
areas.  The Taxi Magic team leverages these incredibly tight feedback
loops to quickly and efficiently contribute back to the community.
</p>

<p>
RideCharge/TaxiMagic has directly sponsored FreeBSD developers to
enhance freebsd-update(8). We now use this update to quickly update
every machine to maintain PCI DSS Level 1 compliance.  These great
capabilities are now available to the entire FreeBSD community.

<h2><a name="Apache">The Apache Software Foundation Testimonial</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.apache.org">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>
provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range
of open source software projects. The Foundation provides an established
framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that
simultaneously limits contributors potential legal exposure.
Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process, Apache
projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software products
that attract large communities of users. The pragmatic Apache License
makes it easy for all users, commercial and individual, to deploy Apache
products.
</p>

<p>
The ASF powers half the Internet, petabytes of data, teraflops of
operations, billions of objects, and enhances the lives of countless
users and developers. Established in 1999 to shepherd, develop, and
incubate Open Source innovations, "The Apache Way," the ASF oversees
150+ projects led by a volunteer community of over 350 individual
Members and 3,000 Committers across six continents.
</p>

<p>
ApacheCon North America 2011 was just recently held in Vancouver,
British Columbia, Canada where FreeBSD was a highlight in the DevOps
track talks.  The Apache Software Foundation itself leverages FreeBSD
for nearly all of its <a
href="http://apache.org/dev/machines.html">public facing services</a>
including one of the largest SVN repositories in the world.  Our
repository is mirrored on several continents and contains over 1.4
million revisions stretching for over a decade. We will even be lending
a hand converting the FreeBSD CVS ports tree to SVN.
</p>

<p>
The Apache Software Foundation makes use of both custom FreeBSD
Tinderbox and FreeBSD Update servers to rapidly perform application and
base system updates across multiple datacenters in an automated, quick,
and efficient fashion. The Apache Infrastructure Team frequently works
directly with FreeBSD developers to stress cutting-edge features like
ZFS under real-world loads.
</p>

<p>
Like The FreeBSD Foundation, the ASF is also a 501(c)3 organization. 
Donating to FreeBSD through The FreeBSD Foundation, makes Apache better 
too and will help make your's and others' daily lives less stressful.
