<h2>Dataset for Middlebox Measurement</h2>
<p>We're actively probing paths directed from access networks to our server to test middlebox behavior, such as effects on TCP options, sequence numbering and segmentation.  
</p>
<p>We developed TCPExposure, a measurement tool consists of a client and a server program.  We are recruiting volunteers to run the TCPExposure client to test the path directed to our server.  
<p>

<h3>Early 2011 Snapshot</h3>
<p>142 access networks are probed in 24 countries between 25th September 2010 and 30th April 2011.  
This dataset is used in our paper "<span style="font-style: italic">Is it still possible to extend TCP?</span>".  
This dataset consists of three files based on the destination port (34343, 80 and 443).  
Each path entry starts from the line including "TAG <span style="font-style:italic">Country</span> <span style="font-style:italic">Network type</span>".  <span style="font-style: italic">Network type</span> corresponds to one in our paper.  
Below this line, packets sent and received are printed in tcpdump-like format.  
Global IP addresses are anonymized with preserving prefix.
