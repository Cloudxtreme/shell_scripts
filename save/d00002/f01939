<h3>Q2: What is the relationship between AFS and Kerberos?</h3>
<p>

AFS uses Kerberos V4 for authentication.  There are however some minor
differences between the ka-server supplied by Transarc and an ordinary
Kerberos server.  Those are quite easy to fix. <p>

In Kerberos there is a server that keeps track of all the keys used by
both clients and servers.  Transarc supplies such a server called
kaserver with their software.  This server also supports its own
protocol that is used by the Transarc clients, such as klog.  But
since it also supports the Kerberos V4 protocol you can use normal
Kerberos clients for authenticating against your AFS cell. The
Transarc NT client uses the Kerberos protocol instead of the kaserver
one for some odd reason.
<p>

Some people run a normal Kerberos server with an AFS cell.

<p>

The main differences are that AFS uses 1) a different string-to-key
algorithm, 2) pre-authentication, and 3) rx as a rpc interface (where
Kerberos 4 uses a hand-coded packet). AFS also uses ubik to replicate
its database over the db-servers.

</p><p>

The AFS key (the one stored in <tt>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</tt>) is the same as
the one stored in the ka/Kerberos server <samp>afs@REALM</samp> principal. When
you run <b>kauth username@REALM</b> it also fetches the <samp>afs@REALM</samp> token
(if kauth found that you have an AFS-enabled kernel), and inserts it
into the AFS-client. You can see the token with <b>tokens</b> or
<b>klist -T</b>. There is also two command, <b>afslog</b> and <b>aklog</b>, 
that will get you tokens if you already have tickets .

</p><p>

Both <b>kauth</b> and <b>afslog</b> look in
<tt>/usr/{arla,vice}/etc/ThisCell</tt> to find out what cell to
retrieve tokens for.

</p><p>

You can specify extra cells to get tokens for in the
/usr/{arla,vice}/etc/TheseCells file, and ~/.TheseCells

</p>

<h3>Q3. What is the difference between a cell and a REALM ?</h3>
<p>

Pretty much nothing. A cell is written with lowercase, and a REALM is
always written in uppercase. Most of the time both realm and cell is
the same a your (dns) domain-name.

</p><p>

To keep your sanity, make sure they are all three named the same.

</p>

<!--- ------------------------------ --->

<h3>Q4. What files do I need to edit to make AFS work with Kerberos?</h3>
<p>

Assuming that the name of your realm is the same as your AFS cell
(except that the realm is in uppercase), you will want to set up your
configuration files as follows:

<p>in /usr/arla/etc/CellServDB:

<pre>
&gt;your.cell.name		# Your AFS cell
www.xxx.yyy.zzz			#first afs vldb server IP address
www.xxx.yyy.zzz			#second afs vldb server IP address
www.xxx.yyy.zzz			#third afs vldb server IP address
</pre>

(replacing www.xxx.yyy.zzz with the IP addresses of the servers for
your cell)

</p>
<p>in /etc/krb.conf:

<pre>
YOUR.CELL.NAME
YOUR.CELL.NAME first.server.domain.name admin server
YOUR.CELL.NAME second.server.domain.name admin server
YOUR.CELL.NAME third.server.domain.name admin server
</pre>

(replace 'first.server.domain.name', etc, with the actual names)

</p>
<p>It may be necessary to add the following entry in /etc/krb.realms for
things to work right with kth-krb: 

.server.domain.name	YOUR.CELL.NAME


(where .server.domain.name is the domain that your servers are in)

<h3>Q5. What if I do not use the standard syscall number?</h3>
<p>

Set the environment variable <var>AFS_SYSCALL</var> to a name or a
number. If it's a name it will be looked up in (the Solaris inspired
file) <tt>/etc/name_to_sysnum</tt> that have the syntax

<p></p>

<pre>
  #name			number
  xfs			230
</pre>

</p>

<h3>Q6. I have problems with getcwd/lib5 programs on Linux.
Or, Matlab/Acroread/something else crashes in strange ways when my
working directory is in AFS.  How should I fix this?
</h3>
<p>

Try using libgetcwd.so, it might work. If you only want to use 
libgetcwd.so for one program, write a shell-script wrapper to set
and export the <var>LD_PRELOAD</var> variable.

<p>From INSTALL:

<pre>
  1. Copy /usr/arla/lib/libgetcwd.so.X (where X is the arla version)
     to /lib.
  2. Run "/sbin/ldconfig".
  3. Run "LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libgetcwd.so.0 /bin/pwd". If this fails
     with "/bin/pwd: can't load library '/lib/libgetcwd.so.0'" or
     some other error message, report this error.
  4. If the previous step went well, add this line to /etc/ld.so.preload:
     /lib/libgetcwd.so.0

  DO NOT load the file from /usr/arla/lib, since /usr probably is not
  part of the root partition of your system. If you do this, your system
  will probably not be able to boot, even in single user, since in most
  Linux installations, init, sh, mount and other programs are dynamically
  linked.
</pre>

</p>

<h3>Q7. I have problems using klog, what should I look for ?</h3>
<p>

Many of the problems with klog somewhat related to that we uses the
kerberos lib kafs to get tokens. <p>

You should first make sure you have the right time. To set time you
can use rdate or <a href="http://www.ntp.org/">ntp</a> that you can
get from <a href="ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/ntp/ntp4/">
ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/ntp/ntp4/</a>  <p>

If you are running ka-server 3.3 (check with <b>rxdebug -version
my-kaserver</b>) (not 3.3a) it might return the wrong error-message
when trying to fetch the <var>afs.cell@cell</var> ticket. Don't know
how right that is. <p>

You should also check out <a href="#q4">question 3</a> since its
related due to that we uses kerberos. <p>

Please not that <b>kauth</b> (or <b>kinit</b> with <b>afslog</b>)is a
perfect replacement for klog. That is, it they doesn't work, klog wont
work either.<p>

A klog from transarc should work perfectly ok with arlad/xfs. It wont
see any any difference between the transarc client and arla. <p>

<h3>Q8. I have strange problems while getting Solaris to work ?</h3>
<p>

You should try to set AFSSYSCALL to xfs or the number of xfs i
/etc/name_to_sysnum.
