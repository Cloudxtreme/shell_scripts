     Provided that these terms and disclaimer and all copyright notices are

     to deal in this work without restriction, including unlimited rights to
     use, publicly perform, distribute, sell, modify, merge, give away, or
     sublicence.

     Where legally impermissible the licensor does not disclaim liability for
     direct physical injury or death caused solely by defects in the work un-
     less it is modified by a third party.

     This work is provided "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind, to the
     utmost extent permitted by applicable law, neither express nor implied;
     without malicious intent or gross negligence. In no event may a licensor,
     author or contributor be held liable for indirect, direct, other damage,
     loss, or other issues arising in any way out of dealing in the work, even
     if advised of the possibility of such damage or existence of a defect,
     except proven that it results out of said person's immediate fault when
     using the work as intended.

     This licence agreement shall be governed in all aspects by the law of
     Germany; designated place of court is Bonn, NRW, Germany.
     (Gerichtsstand ist Bonn, NRW/Deutschland. Es gilt deutsches Recht.)

     I as the MirOS Project leader and MirBSD's owner hereby assert a
     collective-work copyright on "MirBSD" including the MirPorts Framework
     and the (OpenBSD-derived) kernel and userland, as well as the MirOS Port-
     able Subprojects (for example, mksh, MirMake and jupp), but excluding
     single ports, the contributed sections (the modules gcc, x11 and contrib)
     and any part of MirBSD that is either marked as "Public Domain" and not
     derived from another project's work under a good copyright licence, or
     with copyright assignments in place, unless stated otherwise. Please note
     that this copyright still applies to some work contained within the X11
     and contrib modules.
</pre><h2>MIDNIGHTBSD</h2><pre>
     Some code has been derived from the compilation of software known as Mid-
     nightBSD (which is derived from the compilation of software known as
     FreeBSD); in particular, code which would otherwise be only accessible to
     USA citizens as Public Domain was relicenced that way. For these, the
     following terms apply:
