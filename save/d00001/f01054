<h1>Travel Information</h1>
<p>Berlin is the capital of Germany. <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Berlin">wikitravel.org</a>
provides nice informations about what you can do with your stay in Berlin.</p>

<p>When you're interested in Hacker culture or want to meet a large bunch of coders,
hackers and whatever thinks it belongs there, you should definetly have a look at
the <a href="http://c-base.org">c-base</a>.

<h2>Getting there</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>
<p>There are two airports in Berlin, named Tegel (TXL) or Sch&ouml;nefeld (SXF).</p>

<p>From Tegel Airport, take the bus TXL driving to "S+U Alexanderplatz" up to the 
station "U Turmstrasse", then walk through the small park to the other side of
the bus station to take the M27 to "S+U Pankow" or the 123 to "Invalidenpark",
depending on which comes first.
You have to get off in Quitzowstrasse, and after getting of the bus, turn left
to follow the bus' direction, but immediately turn right into the "Lehrter
Strasse". Then you're almost there, just a few steps until on the right, there's
the IN-Berlin.
For this ride, you just have to pay one full fare, which is 2.40 Euro (AB 
ticket).</p>

<p>From Schoenefeld Airport, you have to pay full fare but an ABC ticket, which is
3.10 Euro.
You can either take the RB14 (driving to "Nauen") or RE7 (driving to "Dessau,
Hauptbahnhof" or "Bad Belzig, Hauptbahnhof") up to "Berlin Hauptbahnhof". Then
follow the description of how to get there via train.</p>

<h3>By train</h3>
<p>Coming by train, you'll most probably end up in Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Berlin main
station).
When you are there, get out of the North entrance of the Hauptbahnhof, walk over
the street and get into the 123 driving to "Saatwinker Damm, Maeckeritzwiesen".
You have to get off the bus in "Krumme Strasse" and follow the bus' direction,
but when you have a playground on the right, switch to the other side of the 
street, walk a few meters further, until on the left you have the IN-Berlin.</p>

<p>There are several trains connecting Berlin directly with many other European and 
German cities. You can use the excellent online ticketing system of the Deutsche
Bahn to book a ticket: <a href="http://bahn.de">bahn.de</a></p>

<h3>By bus</h3>
<p>When you take the bus to go to Berlin, you'll most probably end up in the 
Central Omnibus Station (Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof). When you are there, follow
the signs inside the station to the entrance where you still have to walk a few 
meters to get to the S-Bahn station "S Messe Nord/ICC". Going down there, you 
have to take the S41 which is driving in a ring in clockwise direction (!), i.e.
it doesn't have a final destination. Do <b>not</b> take the S42 driving against
clockwise direction, you'll have to drive 3/4 of the ring instead of just 1/4.
You get off the train in Beusselstrasse and there, get out of the train station
and take the 123 driving to "Invalidenpark".</p>

<p>You have to get off in Quitzowstrasse, and after getting of the bus, turn left
to follow the bus' direction, but immediately turn right into the "Lehrter
Strasse". Then you're almost there, just a few steps until on the right, there's
the IN-Berlin.
For this ride, you just have to pay one full fare, which is 2.40 Euro (AB 
ticket).</p>

<p>Different to the rest of Germany, Berlin has many bus lines connecting it to 
the rest of Germany and Europe. You can look for cheap fares on
<a href="https://www.berlinlinienbus.de/index.php">berlinlinienbus.de</a>.</p>

<h3>By car</h3>
<p>When you come by car, you have to somehow get to the conference site: <a 
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=52.53443&lon=13.358479&zoom=18&layers=M">OSM.org</a>.</p>

<p>As the Lehrter Strasse is usually crowded, you should look for a parking lot 
in the nearby Kruppstrasse.</p>

<h2>Recommended Hotels</h2>
<p>There are three hotels/hostels nearby. Though their distances are different, 
they are all close to the conference site, maximum 15 minutes by foot or three 
bus stations (you don't have to take the full fare, but short fare for 1.40 
Euro).</p>

<h3>Motel One Berlin Hauptbahnhof</h3>
<p>The <a 
href="http://www.motel-one.com/de/hotels/berlin/hotel-berlin-hauptbahnhof/#t=hotelinfo">Motel 
One</a> is the most expensive hotel, prices starting at 69 Euro per night.</p>

<h3>AO Hostel/Hotel Berlin Hauptbahnhof</h3>
<p>The closest location is the <a 
href="http://www.aohostels.com/de/berlin/berlin-hauptbahnhof/">AO Hostel</a>,
also with prices ranging from very cheap (for six-bed-dorms
9 Euro per night) up to a bit higher for single rooms (starting at 29 per 
night). It is one bus stop closer than the other two.</p>

<h3>G&auml;stehaus im Zentrum</h3>
<p>The <a 
href="http://gaestehaeuser.berliner-stadtmission.org/gaestehaus-im-zentrum">Christian 
G&auml;stehaus</a> also provides cheap rooms and is appr. as far away as the 
Motel One, starting from 22 Euro for a 6-bed dorm up to 34 Euro for a single 
room.</p>

<h2>Conference site</h2>

<p>The conference site is the <a href="http://in-berlin.de/space/">space of the 
IN-Berlin e.V.</a>, a local community-driven Internet Provider in Berlin.</p>

<p>It is barely visible from the street, you have to watch out for the shopping 
windows to get the right place. Though it is located in the Lehrter Str. 53, you 
should not go to the house entrance but look for the front entrance of the 
space.</p>
