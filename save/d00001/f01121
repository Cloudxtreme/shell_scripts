<h2>I need USB!</h2>

Ofcourse everyone knows, USB is cool. Currently, I am working
on USB driver on BSD/OS. Actually, it's a porting of NetBSD's
driver.
<p>

<hr>

<h2>I need 16bit PCM on my notebook!</h2>

Chandra, my notebook, has ESS sound chip. But native
BSD/OS can detect this chip only as SoundBlaster Pro.
It can only play 8bit PCM. It isn't comfortable especially
to play SMF by TiMidity and MP3.<br>

Currently, NetBSD and FreeBSD can use ESS Chip in native 16 bit mode.
Now I am working to port this driver to BSD/OS.  And as the next step,
I will port Luigi Rizzo's snd driver to BSD/OS if time permits.  <p>

<hr>

<h2>I need WirelessLAN!</h2>

Now IEEE802.11 based wireless LAN card is available. And its driver
for FreeBSD is also available at
<a href="http://www.cas.trans-nt.com/~cas/ux/">here</a>.  The driver is
ported to BSD/OS by <a href="http://www.itojun.org">itojun</a>.
I am debugging the driver now.
<p>

CURRENT STATUS:<br>
No interrupts rise. It's funny. Why?

<h2>I need MIDI!</h2>

Some SoundBlaster as known as VIBRA16 need special initialization
to enable MIDI port. I've desired MIDI port on VIBRA16 chip.
The patch is delivered from newer version of Voxware.<p>

[It was a hack at 1997]<p>

<a href="sb16_midi.c.for_vibra.diff">Here's a patch for BSD/OS 3.1 </a>

<p>

To apply this patch, follow this steps.
<ul>
  <li> % cd /sys/i386/isa/sound
  <li> % patch < ${SOMEWHERE}/sb16_midi.c.for_vibra.diff
  <li> reconfigure your kernel
</ul>

TECHNICAL NOTES:<br>
Vibra16 chip requires initialization of assignment of I/O
address for MIDI interface. 0x300 and 0x330 are selectable.
Selecting the I/O address, certain value should be  set to mixer
register.<p>

<pre>
unsigned char   bits = sb_getmixer (0x84) &amp; ~0x06;
....
case 0x300:
  sb_setmixer (0x84, bits | 0x04);
  break;
case 0x330:
  sb_setmixer (0x84, bits | 0x00);
  break;
</pre>

<h2>I need MIDI more!</h2>

Roland SCP-55 is a PCMCIA MIDI card that is compatible with
GS standard. I developed device driver for this card.
Using this driver and UART SMF player such ad midiplay,
you can play SMF.

But unfortunately, this patch doesn't work well.
If you initialize the card on Windows and boot BSD/OS,
the card will work slightly better. But not perfect.
Volume control seems getting crazy. <p>

[It was a hack at 1996]<p>

Here's a tarball for BSD/OS 3.1

<p>

Installation is to be the following steps:

<p>

TECHNICAL NOTES:<br> SCP-55 is basically compatible with UART MIDI
device.  Once the card is attached, it acts as same as MPU-401 UART
mode.  Some special registers for mixer are added.
Probably special initialization is needed, but I have
no information about that. That is why this driver doesn't
work perfectly.

<h2>I need joysticks!</h2>

It is quite easy to implement generic joystick driver on BSD/OS.
<p>

[It was a hack at 1998 (actully one night hack)]<p>

<a href="joystick_bsdos3.tar.gz">Here's a tarball for BSD/OS 3.1</a>

<p>
Please see 00README included the tarball for more details.

<h2>I need ATAPI-PD drives!</h2>

ATAPI PD drives are large and cheap strorage devices. They
are very useful for me.<p>

[It was a hack at 1998]<p>

<a href="atapi_pd.980515.diff">Here's a patch for BSD/OS 3.1</a>

<p>

To apply this patch, follow this steps.

<ul>
  <li> % cd /sys
  <li> % patch -p1 < ${SOMEWHERE}/atapi_pd.980515.diff
  <li> reconfigure your kernel
</ul>

TECHNICAL NOTES:<br>

ATAPI packet format is similar to that of SCSI.
As far as the ATAPI specification, the field where LUN places
in SCSI packet is defined as 'not-used'. But ATAPI-PD drives
use this field to change CD-ROM and PD. 
ATAPI-PD driver must do the followings:
<ul>
  <li> Probe the ATAPI-PD drive using drive name.
  <li> Attach two devices, CD-ROM and PD.
  <li> When to read or write, fill the LUN field appropriately
       corresponding to device minor number.
</ul>

As far as BSD/OS, ATAPI removable drives are operated under SCSI
emulation. Therefore, modifying the driver was not so difficult.<p>

But, in my patch, SCSI-LUN is filled just before sending packets.  It
is not smart, I think. SCSI-LUN should be set at more appropriate
place.  Please do not forget that this patch is very ad-hoc.  <p>

If your ATAPI-PD drive isn't recognized, please add the name of drive
to wdpi_special_list[] at /sys/i386/isa/wdpi.c.<p>

<h2>I need 'shutdown -x'</h2>

Obsolete.
