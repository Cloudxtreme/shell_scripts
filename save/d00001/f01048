Tony Hill established Capital Hill Consulting following a background in senior
government and information management extending over two decades. He is now
working to develop the capabilities and skills needed in organisations to
participate successfully in a knowledge society.

     <br /><br />

In his role as principal of Capital Hill Consulting Pty Ltd, Tony Hill provides
consulting advice on large scale research funding, including strategic
research management and cooperative research arrangements. He has been
instrumental in developing successful funding of a range of major research
ventures in Australia and has been advisor to governments on establishing new
programs for developing effective linkages and knowledge transfer between
industry, universities and government research labs.

     <br /><br />

He commenced as Executive Director of the Internet Society of Australia
(ISOC-AU) in September 1999. ISOC-AU is a chapter of the global Internet
Society (ISOC) which is an umbrella organisation for the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). ISOC-AU aims to be a voice for Australian users of the
Internet. Members of the society include many of the people who established the
Internet in Australia. Further information on ISOC-AU is available from
<a href="http://www.isoc-au.org.au">www.isoc-au.org.au</a>

     <br /><br />

Between 1993 and 1999, he was Manager of the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC)
Programme in the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. In that time he
had a significant role in supporting the development of policy for the CRC
Programme and managing secretariat support to the CRC Committee and its
selection and review panels. The CRC Programme supports cooperative research,
development, education and training activities in more than 65 CRCs with
approximately $140 million in program funds each year.

     <br /><br />

In 1995, he was Secretary to the CRC Programme Evaluation Steering Committee
(Myers Committee). He was closely involved with analysing the Committee's 160
public submissions, briefing for the Committee and drafting its report. He also
participated in the bulk of the Committee's 80 consultations held around
Australia and its 25 overseas consultations.

     <br /><br />

He has had a 20 year career with the Commonwealth Public Service. Over that
period he worked with seven Commonwealth agencies, including Department of
Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,
Department of Housing and Construction, Department of Administrative Services,
Department of Social Security and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

     <br /><br />

Tony's academic qualifications include economics and geography at the
undergraduate level, and a Masters of Environmental Studies. In 1994, he
completed the Graduate Certificate in Public Sector Management.

Robyn Porter has a background in scientific research (mostly protein
biochemistry and biotechnology), intellectual property and management of
government granting programmes.

<br /><br />
She commenced with the CRC Programme in February 1997 as a Liaison Officer. In
this position she negotiated and administered multi-million dollar contracts.
This included liaison with a variety of individuals and incorporated provision
of information and advice on the CRC Programme. She also prepared briefing
material and provided secretariat support for expert review panels and policy
advice.

<br /><br />
During her time with the Commonwealth Government, she also spent a year
undertaking research and assisted with the development of policy advice,
legislation and administration of programmes in the Coal industry.

<br /><br />
Between 1990 and 1997, she was a patent examiner in biotechnology for IP
Australia. This involved the investigation and reporting on whether a person
or a company was entitled under Australian legislation to patent protection for
inventions based on technological innovation. During this time, Robyn also
studied Patent, Trade Mark and Design law with a view to becoming a patent
attorney. This has given her a good understanding of intellectual property
management and the requirements for managing the 'publish or perish' mentality
of academe.

<br /><br />
Prior to this, she spent several years undertaking research in various
laboratories and has contributed to research publications. This has given her a
thorough understanding of the challenges facing researchers at the bench. It
also enables her to talk to scientists about the challenges in taking research
from the bench to commercialisation.

<br /><br />
Robyn's academic qualifications include chemistry, mathematics and physics at
the undergraduate level, and a Graduate Diploma in Management (Technology
Management). She has enrolled to undertake a PhD in commercialisation and
innovation.
