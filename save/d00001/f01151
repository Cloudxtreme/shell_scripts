<h1>U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA)</h1>

<p> Privacy and authentication on the Internet are always hotly-debated
topics. Different people have wildly different views on how to balance
privacy with law enforcement, and how to balance authentication with
privacy. The fact that many countries have radically different laws
about privacy makes an international debate all that much harder to
hold.

<p> Within the privacy debate, one of the sub-topics that has personal
meaning for many people is the transmission of medical records over the
Internet. As the medical world moves from paper to electronic records,
many people have become frightened by the careless handling of these
records, such as when a hospital or doctor accidentally makes patient
records accessible over the Internet.

<p>In 1996, the U.S. passed a large healthcare law called the "Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act", commonly referred to as
"HIPAA". The law has many parts, but one that has generated a great deal
of concern in the U.S. health care industry is the section on privacy of
patient records. That section caused the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services to create rules about patients' access to their medical
records and control over the use of their personal health information.
More significantly for the health industry, the rule also describes the
responsibility for health care providers and health plans to protect the
privacy of the patients' records. These providers must follow those
rules starting in 2003 and 2004.

<h2>Implications of HIPAA for the VPN Industry</h2>

<p>The new rules are fairly extensive. The part most relevant to the VPN
industry is the rule requiring "securing patient records containing
individually identifiable health information so that they are not
readily available to those who do not need them." The rules do not
specify which technologies should be used to preserve confidentiality of
patient records, so individual health care facilities can chose which
technologies will best suit their needs while being secure enough to
prevent improper access to patient records.

<p>Many health care companies already have VPNs in place for their
internal use, while others are in various states of deployment of VPNs.
IPsec VPNs that are used for site-to-site encryption will prevent
snooping of patient records between the two sites, and both
IPsec and SSL VPNs can be used for securing remote users who are accessing
centralized records. Most VPN systems
today allow for unrelated sites that have a common trusted third party
to easily encrypt all of the traffic between the sites. Thus, there is a
great deal of interest in using VPNs to comply with parts of the HIPAA
rules.

<h2>HIPAA information from VPNC Members</h2>

<p>Because IPsec is considered to be a good means for securing patient
records over the Internet, many of VPNC's members have created HIPAA-specific
information for their customers. The following lists links from VPNC's
members.

<h2>More Information on HIPAA</h2>

<p>The U.S. government has a significant site about HIPAA:
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/</a>.
It is a good starting place for health care professionals
and those who are creating secure services for them.

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.hipaasummit.com/">conference on
HIPAA</a> covering a wide range of legal and technical issues.
