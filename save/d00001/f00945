		<p>Following the resignation of the ALAC representative from the North American region, appointed by ICANN's 2010 Nominating Committee (NomCom), the 2011 NomCom invites Statements of Interest for this important ICANN leadership position.</p>
		<p>Interested individuals from the North American region are invited to submit a Statement of Interest to become an At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) representative for the remainder of the current term, ending at the ICANN Annual General Meeting in 2012.</p>
		<p>North American citizens who submitted SOIs in 2011, or carried forward previous SOIs into the 2011 process, will be invited to update their statements and have them considered by the NomCom.

		<p>The At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) is the ICANN body responsible for representing the voice of the end user in policy and operational discussions. For more information on the work of the ALAC see <a href="http://www.atlarge.icann.org/"> http://www.atlarge.icann.org/</a>. To fill this interim vacancy the NomCom is seeking an accomplished person of integrity, objectivity and intelligence who has:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a commitment to ICANN's mission and an understanding of the potential impact of ICANN decisions on the global Internet community</li>
			<li>an understanding of the DNS and the impact of ICANN policy on end users</li>

		</ul>
		<p>More information about the position can be found in the 2011 NomCom "leadership positions" document <a href="/positions-2011.htm">http://nomcom.icann.org/positions-2011.htm</a></p>
		<p>More information regarding the Nominating Committee can be found at <a href="/">http://nomcom.icann.org/</a>. Applications will be considered in confidence and should be received by 25 July 2011 for full consideration.

The successful candidate will be invited to participate in ICANN #42 Meeting to be held in Dakar, Senegal, 23-28 October 2011.</p>
<h4>Background:</h4>
		<p>The Nominating Committee is designed to function independently from the ICANN Board, Supporting Organizations, and Advisory Committees. Nominating Committee members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet community and within the scope of the ICANN mission and responsibilities assigned to it by the ICANN Bylaws.</p>
		<p>Nominating Committee members contribute understanding of the broad interests of the Internet community as a whole, and knowledge and experience of specific Internet constituencies who have appointed them.</p>
		<p>The challenge for the Nominating Committee is to integrate these perspectives and derive consensus in its selections. Although appointed by Supporting Organizations and other ICANN entities, individual Nominating Committee members are not accountable to their appointing constituencies.</p>
		<p>Members are accountable for adherence to the ICANN Bylaws and for compliance with the rules and procedures established by the Nominating Committee.</p>
		<p>Successful candidates are not remunerated, although direct expenses incurred in the course of duty will be reimbursed. Fluency in English is a requirement for all positions. These positions may involve significant international travel, including personal presence at periodic ICANN meetings, as well as regular telephone and Internet communications.</p>

		</div>
		<p>ICANN's Nominating Committee (NomCom) invites Statements of Interest and candidate recommendations from the Internet community for key leadership positions to fulfill ICANN's technical and policy coordination role. Interested individuals are invited to submit a Statement of Interest to the 2011 NomCom for the following positions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Two members of the Board of Directors of ICANN</li>
			<li>Three At Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) representatives (one each from the Africa; Asia/Australia/Pacific; and Latin America/Caribbean regions)</li>
			<li>Two members of the Council of the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO)</li>
			<li>One member of the Council of the Country-Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Nominating Committee (NomCom) is an independent committee tasked with selecting a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and other key positions within ICANN's structure. ICANN is an internationally organized, public benefit, non-profit corporation dedicated to: preserving the operational security and stability of the Internet; promoting competition; achieving broad representation of global Internet communities; and supporting the development of policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up, consensus-based processes.</p>
		<p>Individuals selected by NomCom will have a unique opportunity to work with accomplished colleagues from around the globe, address the Internet's intriguing technical coordination problems and policy development challenges with diverse functional, cultural, and geographic dimensions, and gain valuable insights and experience from working across boundaries of knowledge, responsibility and perspective.</p>
		<p>Those selected will gain the satisfaction of making a valuable public service contribution towards the continued function and evolution of an essential global resource. Considering the broad public interest, those selected will work to achieve the goals towards which ICANN is dedicated in order to facilitate the Internet's critically important societal functions.</p>
		<p>Statements of Interest for the positions described above can be submitted through an on-line application form at <a href="/invitation-2011.htm">http://nomcom.icann.org/invitation-2011.htm</a> or by contacting <a href="mailto:nomcom2011@icann.org">nomcom2011@icann.org</a>.</p>
		<p>Applications will be considered in confidence and should be received by 4 April 2011 for full consideration. Selections will be announced in early September 2011. Successful candidates will take up their positions following ICANN's Annual Meeting in October 2011.</p>
		<p>Candidate recommendations, questions or comments may also be emailed to <a href="mailto:nomcom2011@icann.org">nomcom2011@icann.org</a>.</p>
		<p>Information about the 2011 Nominating Committee is available at <a href="/">http://nomcom.icann.org/</a>.</p>
		<h4><a name="charge"></a>Committee's Charge</h4>
		<p>The NomCom is responsible for the selection of all ICANN Directors except the President and those selected by ICANN's Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees for such other selections as are set forth in the Bylaws. [<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/bylaws.htm#VII-1">Bylaws Article VII, Section 1</a>]</p>
		<p>The NomCom is charged with populating a portion of the ICANN Board as noted above, as well as the ALAC, the ccNSO Council and GNSO Council. The NomCom complements the other means for filling a portion of key ICANN leadership positions achieved within the Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees.</p>
		<p>The Bylaws also state that the Nominating Committee shall adopt such operating procedures as it deems necessary, which shall be published on the ICANN website.</p>
		<p>The Nominating Committee is designed to function independently from the Board, the Supporting Organizations, and Advisory Committees. Nominating Committee members act only on behalf of the interests of the global Internet community and within the scope of the ICANN mission and responsibilities assigned to it by the ICANN Bylaws.</p>
		<p>Members contribute to the Nominating Committee both their understanding of the broad interests of the Internet as a whole and their knowledge and experience of the concerns and interests of the Internet constituencies which have appointed them. The challenge for the Nominating Committee is to integrate these perspectives and derive consensus in its selections. Although appointed by Supporting Organizations and other ICANN entities, individual Nominating Committee members are not accountable to their appointing constituencies. Members are, of course, accountable for adherence to the Bylaws and for compliance with the rules and procedures established by the Nominating Committee.</p>

Meetings during 2011 are scheduled for San Francisco, U.S.A., Asia/Australia/Pacific and Africa regions. The diverse locations facilitate participation across the world's Internet community; an aspect of growing importance as ICANN's recently signed Affirmation of Commitments emphasizes ICANN's accountability to the community.</p>
