Some person can create, others can not. I wish to be the former.<p>

There are serveral way to contribute to the world. My way is to create,
to produce, to develop.<p>

I never forget to creative mind. Even at the time of my death,
I wish to say, 'Well, what shall I create next?'
<p>

That is 'The only neat thing to do' by myself.
