<p class="tb">The Cyber Kansai Project is active in the following:</p>
<p class="tb">
- Promotion of spreading Internet technology in the Kansai region<br>
- Formulation of a common basis for business applications</p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="title"><strong>Experimental Activities</strong></p>
<p class="tb">
Åú Expansion of the Cyber Kansai homepage (http://ckp.jp)<br>
Åú Development and testing of new applications</p><br>
<p class="title"><strong>* Development of a construction method for a server capable of stable and trouble-free handling of large-volume data</strong></p>
<p class="tb">Service provision on the Internet today is not protected against server or network breakdown by hardware that automatically switches over to back-up servers, or against overload conditions by the use of load distribution mechanisms.  This makes the stable provision of services difficult.  In this experiment, we are developing a server construction method that will permit stable service provision to users.  It is our intention to load Cyber Kansai onto a server that will be built to function smoothly also at times of  heavy-volume multiple access.</p><br>
<p class="title"><strong>* Experiments towards the creation of technologies enabling joint production work over the Internet</strong></p>
<p class="tb">It is quite natural to assume that when the next generation of complex high-speed networks are complete, the Internet will be used not only for obtaining and transmitting information, but as a platform for joint production projects bringing together people in diverse media and locations. However, before such a working environment on the Internet can be realized, related technologies to streamline production work and to guarantee product quality must be developed.</p><br>
<p class="title"><strong>* Development of standardized technology for business applications</strong></p>
<p class="tb">Although a great deal of research and development is geared toward enabling use of the Internet as a vehicle for business projects, there is no standardized technology, and a wide variety of incompatible systems are currently in use. Further, while technologies for selling products over the Internet are being developed, the same cannot be said for a system permitting the direct sales of multimedia contents. Consequently, we will be working on developing such a system with regard to several media including moving images and music.</p><br>
<p class="title"><strong>* Development of Related Basic Technologies</strong></p>
<p class="tb">In order to make the above experiments possible, the development of certain basic technologies is essential.</p></td></tr>
