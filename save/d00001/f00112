<h1>Presentations</h1>

<p>There is no specific time for each talk. Talks will start on Saturday at
12pm, and will be held in the order as listed here. There will be a pause 
between 14:00pm and 15:00pm, but apart from that, they will be held one after 
the other.</p>

<p><b>As there is no tight schedule, you can still submit talk proposals! You 
could even have spontaneous talks on the conference itself, provided you find an 
audience. Please send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:pkgsrccon-2013@pkgsrcCon.pkgsrc.org">pkgsrccon-2013@pkgsrcCon.pkgsrc.org</a></b></p>

			Thomas Klausner will give a short overview of the work of pkgsrc 
			release engineering. What must be done for a branch, what is the 
			procedure of branching, packaging, distributing and maintaining a 
			pkgsrc release?

			Joyent operate a large, high-performance public cloud running on

			<b>[60 minutes]</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			DeforaOS is an Open Source project, aiming at improving the 
			overall user experience and possibilities offered by modern 
			Operating Systems. The main goal is to allow remote and secure 
			access to one's own resources, also when they are found on a 
			private desktop system at home and accessed from a mobile phone 
			over an untrusted network.<br>
			It notably proposes a desktop user environment, eventually able 
			to expose these features to the end user. Meanwhile, it aims at 
			being a lightweight, coherent, usable and portable environment 
			suitable for the platforms typically targeted by the pkgsrc 
			project.

	analysis and quality assurance of FOSS distributions</li>
	<li class="description">
		<p>
			<b>[60 minutes]</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			We will present a set of tools for the analysis and quality
			assurance of FOSS distributions. These tools analyse meta-data of
			packages (like dependencies, build-dependencies, conflicts, etc),
			and answer questions like:

			<ul>
				<li> which packages are installable and which are not?</li>
				<li> for which packages is it possible to install a build 
				environment?</li>
				<li> which packages are absolutely mandatory for the 
				installation of a package (which might have dependencies with 
				alternatives, or on virtual packages)?</li>
				<li> which packages will certainly become uninstallable when I 
				upgrade a certain package?</li>
			</ul>

			This talk is not pkgsrc-specific, but will give an overview over the 
			work done by Mancoosi and discuss possible collaborations between 
			Mancoosi and the pkgsrc community.

	<li class="title">Go On NetBSD</li>
	<li class="description">
		<p>
			<b>[60 minutes]</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Go is a new systems programming language with a focus on concurrency
			and expressiveness. The Go programming language recently gained
			support for running on NetBSD on the i386 (386) and x86_64 (amd64)
			architectures. This support will be part of the upcoming Go 1.1
			release. (FreeBSD had already been supported in the Go 1 release).<br />
			<br />
			This talk gives an introduction to Go and presents some of its
			benefits for systems and network server programming. It will then go
			further into detail regarding its implementation on NetBSD from the
			programmer's and from the admin's point of view.

			<b>[30 minutes]</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			pkglint (pkgtools/pkglint) is a tool to check for certain validity 
			and norming criteria of packages. Amitai Schlair will talk about

	<li class="title">Ansible & EC2 - Orchestrating NetBSD into the cloud</li>
	<li class="description">
		<p>
			<b>[60 minutes]</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Introduce Ansible as system orchestration tool that supports the 
			Amazon EC2 cloud and NetBSD. Show how to get a basic NetBSD system 
			setup, an example database server, web application server and 
			example web application deployed with Ansible. Introduce tools to 
			use Amazon's Xen-based EC2 cloud from NetBSD and with Ansible. Show 
			the roadmap to combine all those tools and deploy NetBSD-based 
			database- and webservers with the example application.
