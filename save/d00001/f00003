Airlines often offer special fares or promotions to Internet users, and
there are some other specialist outfits selling tickets on-line.

<A HREF="http://www.smartertravel.com/" target="link">Smarter Travel</A> collects
weekly specials from selected major cities and both puts them on
their web site and e-mails them to mailing lists.
You can sign up for the cities you're interested in flying from,
as well as general newsletters about travel deals.
</p><p>
Also see their companion site
<A HREF="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com" target="link">Airfare Watchdog</A> which has a fine
compendium of low fares by city, with useful suggestions for nearby cities
that might have lower fares.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.travelzoo.com/" target="link">Travelzoo</A> offers a gazillion different services
including a weekly Top 20 Deals newsletter and a meta-meta-search in which
you tell it the cities and dates, and they offer links to sites you might
want to search.
(Selection surely not affected by how much commission they pay.)
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2175973-10410788">Travelocity</A>
has a Travel Deals page that often has private fares,
two-for-one deals, and the like.
</td></tr></table>
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://deals.bootsnall.com/" target="link">Bootsnall</A> has lists of cheap flights that
include some interesting deals.
</p><p>
<H2>Ticket auctions and the like</H2>
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1866211-10370045" target="link">Priceline</a>
sells tickets over the web using a
peculiar system sort of like an auction.
You tell them where and when you want to go and how much you're willing to
pay.
You have to be prepared to go at any time of day,
on any major domestic airline or one of a list of international ones, and
to accept a stop or change of plane.
You tell them what you're willing to pay, along with credit card info.
If they find a ticket at that price, you've bought it and can't change
or refund it (like most any low-price ticket.)
Flights must originate in the U.S., or via an affiliate, in the U.K.
</p><p>
If they have a ticket available at or below your bid, they'll sell it to you,
but you don't know if you're getting the best price.
They'll charge what you offered even if the carrier would have accepted
less, and they make it difficult to offer increasing bids.
They now offer seats on many the major US airlines and international
airlines. except
A lot of reports, including articles in the
<I>Consumer Reports Travel Letter</I>,
and the
<I>Wall Street Journal</I>,
say that in practice bids for lower than published prices are rarely
accepted, and they admit that they accept less than 10% of the bids
people make, although they do sell 15,000 tickets a day.
They now also offer normal tickets where you know the price and the flights
ahead of time.
I don't see any reason to buy from them rather than anyone else, but this
does at least tell you what the list price is so you don't bid any higher
than that.
</p><p>
I haven't ever bought a ticket through Priceline,
but would welcome more reports from people who have.
(I tried to get a NYC hotel room one time, they turned down all my offers,
but I've heard from at least one person who got a room at a nice Boston
hotel for about half the normal price.)
The idea of auctioning left-over tickets is a good one, and it's a shame
if it can't be put into practice.
If you're planning to travel on a route well-served
by one of the airlines listed above,
and can fly at any time of day, try bidding slightly
less than the best fare you can find on one of the regular reservation sites
or Hotwire and see if they take it.
Otherwise, you're better off with a agent who knows about unpublished
fares, many of whom are listed in subsequent sections of this FAQ.
</p><p>
<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=24474.10001216&type=3&subid=3" >Hotwire</a>
is a sort of competitor to Priceline now owned by InterActive Corp
which owns Expedia and Hotels.com.
You tell them where you want to go, what dates, and a few conditions
such as no red-eye, and they offer you a price.
Unlike Priceline
they tell you what price you'll pay
and have an hour to decide before you buy it.
Like Priceline, you don't get to know the times and airline until you
buy the tickets.
Hotwire is another good place to check for last minute tickets.
It hasn't yet ever offered me a ticket I wanted to buy, but
considering that I fly from Ithaca NY, not exactly
a hotbed of airline competition, I can't say I'm surprised.
Flights must originate in the U.S., but you can fly internationally.
They also sell hotels and rental cars on the same basis;
I've gotten some good rental car deals all of which have turned out to be from Budget.
</p><p>
<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=4ItCxKJ7sfM&offerid=79676.10000002&type=3&subid=3" >SkyAuction</a>,
in contrast to Priceline and Hotwire, auctions
off tickets and travel packages using a "second bid" scheme similar to what
eBay and other online auctioneers use.
(The best strategy is to bid the maximum you're willing to pay,
since if you win you'll pay just enough to beat the runner up regardless of
what your maximum was.)
The descriptions of what they're selling are quite concrete, and you can
see what the competing bids are.
Tickets are offered in small lots, you can end up with fewer tickets than
you asked for unless you make a bid "all or nothing".
Be sure to add in the often large service charge for each ticket, and be
sure you know what normal fares are since tickets are often bid up above
published fares.
I've bought tickets to London through them, their service was prompt
and efficient, but I've seen reports that it is very difficult to get a
refund if there's a problem with the flights.
</p><p>
General auction sites often have airline tickets available.
You can find them in "Miscellaneous:Travel" at
<A HREF="http://listings.ebay.com/aw/listings/list/category1310/index.html" target="link">eBay</A>.
Many of the tickets offered appear either to be frequent flyer tickets,
which the airline will confiscate if they can tell that you bought them,
or dubious deals where the air tickets are "free" if you buy an expensive
vacation package.
There do seem to be a few transferrable bump certificates, and quite a few
ancillary items like drink coupons.
</p><p>
<A NAME="#site59"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.site59.com/" target="link">Site 59</A> offers last minute weekend travel packages.
They all include air and hotel, but the price is often lower than what
you'd otherwise pay for air only
(<A HREF="services.phtml#travelocity">Travelocity's</A>
"last minute deals" are really Site59.)
