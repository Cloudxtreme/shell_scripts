There's lots of them, grouped below by location of the agent
and type of service.
</p><p>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
All of the descriptions below are edited from info provided by the
agencies themselves.  There are many resources other than travel agents
available on the net, as well, but they're not listed here.
Most agencies offer a broad range of services, so the groupings by type of service
below are pretty arbitrary.
</p><p>
<HR>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
If you're a travel agent and would like to be listed, drop me a note
and I'll add you.  Please make my life easier by e-mailing me a three-line or
so description in the style above.  Thanks.
