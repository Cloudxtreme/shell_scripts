<p>##Overview</p>

<p>The NTP module installs, configures, and manages the ntp service.</p>

<p>##Module Description</p>

<p>The NTP module handles running NTP across a range of operating systems and<br>
distributions.  Where possible we use the upstream ntp templates so that the<br>
results closely match what you&#39;d get if you modified the package default conf<br>
files.</p>

<p>##Setup</p>

<p>###What ntp affects</p>

<ul>
<li>ntp package.</li>
<li>ntp configuration file.</li>
<li>ntp service.</li>
</ul>

<p>###Beginning with ntp</p>

<p>include &#39;::ntp&#39; is enough to get you up and running.  If you wish to pass in<br>
parameters like which servers to use then you can use:</p>

<pre lang="puppet"><code>class { &#39;::ntp&#39;:
  servers =&gt; [ &#39;ntp1.corp.com&#39;, &#39;ntp2.corp.com&#39; ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>##Usage</p>

<p>All interaction with the ntp module can do be done through the main ntp class.<br>
This means you can simply toggle the options in the ntp class to get at the<br>
full functionality.</p>

<p>###I just want NTP, what&#39;s the minimum I need?</p>

<pre lang="puppet"><code>include &#39;::ntp&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>###I just want to tweak the servers, nothing else.</p>

<pre lang="puppet"><code>class { &#39;::ntp&#39;:
  servers =&gt; [ &#39;ntp1.corp.com&#39;, &#39;ntp2.corp.com&#39; ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>###I&#39;d like to make sure I restrict who can connect as well.</p>

<pre lang="puppet"><code>class { &#39;::ntp&#39;:
  servers  =&gt; [ &#39;ntp1.corp.com&#39;, &#39;ntp2.corp.com&#39; ],
  restrict =&gt; &#39;restrict 127.0.0.1&#39;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>###I&#39;d like to opt out of having the service controlled, we use another tool for that.</p>

<pre lang="puppet"><code>class { &#39;::ntp&#39;:
  servers        =&gt; [ &#39;ntp1.corp.com&#39;, &#39;ntp2.corp.com&#39; ],
  restrict       =&gt; &#39;restrict 127.0.0.1&#39;,
  manage_service =&gt; false,
}
</code></pre>

<p>###Looks great!  But I&#39;d like a different template, we need to do something unique here.</p>

<pre lang="puppet"><code>class { &#39;::ntp&#39;:
  servers         =&gt; [ &#39;ntp1.corp.com&#39;, &#39;ntp2.corp.com&#39; ],
  restrict        =&gt; &#39;restrict 127.0.0.1&#39;,
  manage_service  =&gt; false,
  config_template =&gt; &#39;different/module/custom.template.erb&#39;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>##Reference</p>

<p>###Classes</p>

<ul>
<li>ntp: Main class, includes all the rest.</li>
<li>ntp::install: Handles the packages.</li>
<li>ntp::config: Handles the configuration file.</li>
<li>ntp::service: Handles the service.</li>
</ul>

<p>###Parameters</p>

<p>The following parameters are available in the ntp module</p>

<p>####<code>autoupdate</code></p>

<p>Deprecated: This parameter previously determined if the ntp module should be<br>
automatically updated to the latest version available.  Replaced by package_<br>
ensure.</p>

<p>####<code>config</code></p>

<p>This sets the file to write ntp configuration into.</p>

<p>####<code>config_template</code></p>

<p>This determines which template puppet should use for the ntp configuration.</p>

<p>####<code>driftfile</code></p>

<p>This sets the location of the driftfile for ntp.</p>

<p>####<code>keys_controlkey</code></p>

<p>Which of the keys is used as the control key.</p>

<p>####<code>keys_enable</code></p>

<p>Should the ntp keys functionality be enabled.</p>

<p>####<code>keys_file</code></p>

<p>Location of the keys file.</p>

<p>####<code>keys_requestkey</code></p>

<p>Which of the keys is used as the request key.</p>

<p>####<code>package_ensure</code></p>

<p>This can be set to &#39;present&#39; or &#39;latest&#39; or a specific version to choose the<br>
ntp package to be installed.</p>

<p>####<code>package_name</code></p>

<p>This determines the name of the package to install.</p>

<p>####<code>panic</code></p>

<p>This determines if ntp should &#39;panic&#39; in the event of a very large clock skew.<br>
We set this to false if you&#39;re on a virtual machine by default as they don&#39;t<br>
do a great job with keeping time.</p>

<p>####<code>preferred_servers</code></p>

<p>List of ntp servers to prefer.  Will append prefer for any server in this list<br>
that also appears in the servers list.</p>

<p>####<code>restrict</code></p>

<p>This sets the restrict options in the ntp configuration.</p>

<p>####<code>servers</code></p>

<p>This selects the servers to use for ntp peers.</p>

<p>####<code>service_enable</code></p>

<p>This determines if the service should be enabled at boot.</p>

<p>####<code>service_ensure</code></p>

<p>This determines if the service should be running or not.</p>

<p>####<code>service_manage</code></p>

<p>This selects if puppet should manage the service in the first place.</p>

<p>####<code>service_name</code></p>

<p>This selects the name of the ntp service for puppet to manage.</p>

<p>##Limitations</p>

<p>This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 2.7 and higher.</p>

<p>The module has been tested on:</p>

<ul>
<li>RedHat Enterprise Linux 5/6</li>
<li>Debian 6/7</li>
<li>CentOS 5/6</li>
<li>Ubuntu 12.04</li>
<li>Gentoo</li>
<li>Arch Linux</li>
<li>FreeBSD</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed. </p>

<p>##Development</p>

<p>Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community<br>
contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canÃ¢ÂÂt access the<br>
huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment<br>
configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.</p>

<p>We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our<br>
modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need<br>
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.</p>

<p>You can read the complete module contribution guide <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing">on the Puppet Labs wiki.</a></p>

        <div name="changelog" class="section" style="display: none;">
          <section class="plaintext"><pre>2013-07-31 - Version 2.0.0

Summary:

The 2.0 release focuses on merging all the distro specific
templates into a single reusable template across all platforms.

To aid in that goal we now allow you to change the driftfile,
ntp keys, and perferred_servers.

Backwards-incompatible changes:

As all the distro specific templates have been removed and a
unified one created you may be missing functionality you
previously relied on.  Please test carefully before rolling
out globally.

Configuration directives that might possibly be affected:
- `filegen`
- `fudge` (for virtual machines)
- `keys`
- `logfile`
- `restrict`
- `restrictkey`
- `statistics`
- `trustedkey`

Features:
- All templates merged into a single template.
- NTP Keys support added.
- Add preferred servers support.
- Parameters in `ntp` class:
 - `driftfile`: path for the ntp driftfile.
 - `keys_enable`: Enable NTP keys feature.
 - `keys_file`: Path for the NTP keys file.
 - `keys_trusted`: Which keys to trust.
 - `keys_controlkey`: Which key to use for the control key.
 - `keys_requestkey`: Which key to use for the request key.
 - `preferred_servers`: Array of servers to prefer.
 - `restrict`: Array of restriction options to apply.

2013-07-15 - Version 1.0.1
Bugfixes:
- Fix deprecated warning in `autoupdate` parameter.
- Correctly quote is_virtual fact.

2013-07-08 - Version 1.0.0
Features:
- Completely refactored to split across several classes.
- rspec-puppet tests rewritten to cover more options.
- rspec-system tests added.
- ArchLinux handled via osfamily instead of special casing.
- parameters in `ntp` class:
 - `autoupdate`: deprecated in favor of directly setting package_ensure.
 - `panic`: set to false if you wish to allow large clock skews. 

2011-11-10 Dan Bode &lt;dan@puppetlabs.com&gt; - 0.0.4
Add Amazon Linux as a supported platform
Add unit tests

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and&#x2F;or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
