    <TD><P>When I was 12 years old, computers started to appear in society.
       Before that, computers were only afforable to large companies.  But
       in the first years of my primary school, the first acceptable
       prized and acceptable sized computers came to the shops.</P>

       <P>In that early time of computers, I caught the computer virus.  I do
       not use them play games, but to realize my ideas.  Once you get to
       know them, it's just like pen and paper: you can use them for many
       kinds of expression.  It's much more creative than most people think.</P>

       <P>The next paragraphs show me how my career in computers developed.
       (But as <A HREF=hobby.html>other pages</A> show you, I also have
        a normal life!)</P></TD>

    <TD><P>My first contact with computers was in 1978, when I was member
        of the DJO (Dutch Young Scientists) in Arnhem.  Actually: I still am
        a member of that organization.  They changed their name into <A
        HREF=http://www.tcja.nl>TCJA</A> (Tecnical Creative Youth Center).</P>

        <P>A small group of guys build a computer based on the Motorola MC6800
        processor (1MHz) with 512bit RAM-chips in that time.  We are
        spreaking about pre-homecomputer history here.  Jacob Beeksma told me
        how to program (ancient)BASIC and later Fred Melgert tought me MC6800
        (later MC6809) assembler.  These were my first steps.</P>

        <P>When I grew older, I started to explain computers to other kids and
        designed and built a few MC6809-based computers myself.  I found out
       that I prefered building things, not using things other people make.</TD>

    <TD>&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>On my secondary school, the KGL in Arnhem (now part of
        the <A HREF=http://www.gelderscollege.nl>Gelders College</A>)
        we bought some Tandy TRS-80.  Who
        does still remember those?  I spent a lot of break hours
        there.  I wrote quite a lot of small programs at that time.  With the
        math-teacher, we even tried to set-up some training program.</TD>

    <TD>&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD><P>From 1984 till 1990, I studied
        <A HREF=http://www.cs.kun.nl>Informatics</A> (or <EM>Computing
        Science</EM>, if you prefer) at the <A HREF=http://www.kun.nl>University
        of Nijmegen</A>, The Netherlands.  Especially Real-Time, hardware,
        and computer languages did attract my attention.</P>

        <P>The title of the Master Thesis was `Fault Tolerance in Real-Time
        Multi-Controller Systems'; a set of computers which each perform the
        same tasks and check each other continuously for (hardware) problems.
        The five controlling computers in the <I>Space Shuttle</I> are an
        example of such a system.</P></TD>

    <TD>&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>After my graduation from university in 1990 till January 1996, I worked
        at the computing centre of the <A HREF=http://www.nlr.nl>National
        Aerospace Laboratories NLR</A> in the North-East Polder, close to
        Marknesse.</P>

        <P>I had to develop, implement, and maintain software that was used to
        manage a large variety of UNIX platforms; in each case complex
        client/server applications.</P>

        <P>To be a bit more specific, this software controlled
        <UL COMPACT>
        <LI>a centralized backup facility to back-up the disk-contents of over
            100 systems to a tape-robot;
        <LI>user and group access control to a large set of systems (a package
            more powerful and flexible than NIS); and
        <LI>a workstation accounting system.
        </UL>
        The NLR-network included systems with many UNIX-dialects, as there were
        a NEC SX3/22 supercomputer, Control Data mainframes, many SGI systems,
        HP9000s, SUNs, IBM RS6000s, and many more.</P></TD>

    <TD><P>Between March 1996 and May 2002, I was a full-time teacher in
        UNIX related subjects at <A HREF=http://www.ATComputing.nl>AT
        Computing</A> in Nijmegen.  This company is specialized in UNIX
        training and consultancy.</P>

        <P>AT Computing was founded in 1985 and employs 10 full-time
        teachers.  Their knowledge and experience covers all subjects related to
        UNIX based systems in great detail.</P>

        <P>I was specialized in Perl, UNIX system administration, C, and
           the website related trainings.</P></TD>
