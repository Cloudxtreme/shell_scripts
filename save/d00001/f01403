<h1>The Virtual Bookcase : Welcome</h1>
<strong>Welcome</strong> to The Virtual Bookcase.<p>
The site about reviews of books. Reviews submitted by you, the visitor of
this site. A site about reading books and
about sharing information about books and reviews of those books.
A bookcase that you can browse 'virtually' 24 hours a day and where
you can share what books you like and what you think about books.
You can browse the shelves like browsing a library, just by
looking at what's there. The books have scores given by the visitors of the
site, reviews and links to on-line bookshops to look at prices.
<p>
You are welcome to add the books you like, add your own review(s) or just
vote for a book. Or just browse around.
<p>
Authors/publishers of books are especially welcome to add their books.
If you have more then just a few books to add contact the <a href="mailto:webmaster@virtualbookcase.com">webmaster via e-mail</a> so we can work out how
to add your books easier.
I also accept review copies of books for reviewing them for the site. Get
in touch with <a href="mailto:webmaster@virtualbookcase.com">me via e-mail</a>
and I'll reply for books that interest me.
<p>
Relevant press releases can be sent to <a href="mailto:press-releases%40virtualbookcase.com">the press-releases address via e-mail</a>. ASCII format only, no HTML, no Word documents.
<h3>Affiliate programs on this site</h3>
The return from the "affiliate" programs by the on-line bookstores is used
to pay for the running costs (hosting, domain name registration) of this
site.
