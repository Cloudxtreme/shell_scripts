      <h5><a name="extracurricular"></a>What extracurricular activities does UC 
        Berkeley offer for students?</h5>
        
      <p>In addition to sports and cultural activities, there are more than 700 
        registered student organizations on campus. Student groups include academic 
        and professional, ethnic and cultural, political and social action, recreational, 
        religious, and service-oriented programs. The <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/sas/student/GroupSearch.asp">Campus Life & Leadership</a> has more information. </p>
      <h5><a name="disabilities"></a>What services are available for students 
        with disabilities?</h5>
        
      <p>Through the <a href="http://www.dsp.berkeley.edu">Disabled Students' 
        Program</a> (510/642-0518), students with documented permanent disabilities 
        or chronic illnesses can arrange for services from readers, note-takers, 
        sign-language interpreters, and other academic support staff. Additionally, 
        the program offers attendant referrals, assistive technology, and help 
        with housing. </p>
      <h5><a name="purchasecomputer"></a>Where can my student purchase a computer?</h5>
	  <p>The <a href="http://thescholarsworkstation.com">Scholar's Workstation</a> 
        &#8212; the campus's computer store &#8212; sells desktop computers, 
        laptops, software, and peripherals at educational discounts to students.        </p>
      <h5><a name="setupcomputer"></a>Will there be someone to help my student 
        set up her computer when she gets to campus?</h5>
      <p>Students will need to be resourceful and generally self-reliant in setting 
        up their desktop computers or laptops, but there is help. Students living 
        in the residence halls have access to <a href="http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/welcome_to_cal.html#Internet">residence 
        hall computing support</a>. Depending on the level of help your student 
        needs, there are resources for <a href="http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/408computing.html">getting 
        other computer help</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <h5><a name="probation"></a>What happens if my student is on academic probation?</h5>
      <p>Students are placed on <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/probation/definition.html">academic 
        probation</a> if their cumulative UC grade-point average falls below 2.0 
        or if their GPA in any single semester drops below 1.5. Students who have 
        been placed on probation should <a href="/academics/advising.shtml">seek 
        advising</a> in their school or college for help in planning their class 
        schedule or counseling on issues that may be affecting their classwork. 
        Many students experience <a href="http://slc.berkeley.edu/studystrategies/acad_difficulty.htm">academic 
        difficulties</a> at some point during their time at Berkeley, but advisers can help get 
        your student back on track and recommend tutors, counseling, workshops, 
      study groups, and other assistance.</p>
      <h5><a name="academicsupport"></a>My student needs academic support. Where 
        can he find an adviser?</h5>
      <p>All colleges and schools on campus have <a href="/academics/advising.shtml">academic 
        advisers </a>who can help students choose majors, plan their courses of 
        study, and fulfill requirements for graduation. Academic advising is also 
        available at the <a href="http://slc.berkeley.edu">Student Learning Center</a>, 
        the <a href="http://asc.berkeley.edu">Athletic Study Center</a>, and <a href="http://slas.berkeley.edu">Student 
        Life Advising Services</a>.</p>
      <h5><a name="grades"></a>I pay all my son's fees, but when I call 
        the registrar asking for his grades, they won't let me see them. 
        How can I get copies?</h5>
      <p>You can't. Berkeley considers its students to be adults, with all 
        the responsibilities and rights to privacy that adult status entails. 
        The campus complies with the federal <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Default.aspx?PageID=ferpa.html">Family 
        Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a> of 1974, also called the 
        Buckley Amendment, which promotes student privacy by limiting the information 
        that schools are allowed to give out about individual students. So, the 
        campus cannot give you your son's grades without his written permission.      </p>
      <h5><a name="classesfull"></a>My daughter wants to explore psychology and 
        economics as possible majors, but the prerequisite courses were full last 
        semester. How can she get the classes she needs?</h5>
      <p>Some popular majors, like these, are hard to get into, but your daughter 
        shouldn't give up. She can visit the department and put herself 
        on an informal waiting list for next semester (there is no guarantee that 
        she will get in, but the persistent are often rewarded). Most popular 
        courses are also offered in Summer Sessions. </p>

      <p><a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/finaid/undergraduates/eloans.htm">Emergency 
        loans</a> for living expenses are available from the Financial Aid Office 
        for currently registered students. Rules and maximum amounts are subject 
        to change, so have your student check with the Emergency Loan Office in 
        220 Sproul Hall, 510/642-0470. Loans must be repaid in approximately 60 
        days. </p>
      <h5><a name="billing"></a>Who can help me understand the campus billing 
        system?</h5>
      <p><a href="http://studentbilling.berkeley.edu">Billing 
        and payment for student fees is done online only.</a> The campus's

        problems.</p>
      <h5><a name="atm"></a>Are there ATMs on campus? Where is the nearest bank?</h5>
      <p>The campus has several ATM machines representing one bank and three credit 
        unions. The credit union ATMs don't charge for transactions by non-members. 
        Major banks within walking distance of the campus include Wells Fargo, 
        Bank of America, Washington Mutual, and Citibank. All are on the south 
        or west sides of campus. </p>

	  <h5><a name="healthprogram"></a>What kind of student health program is offered 
        at UC Berkeley? </h5>
      <p>Cal offers comprehensive medical, mental health, and health promotion 
        services to all students through <a href="http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu">University 
        Health Services</a> (UHS), the campus's outpatient health center. 
        All registered students may use the services just as they would their 
        doctor's office and urgent care center. The facility is fully accredited 
        and staffed by board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, physician's 
        assistants, a nutritionist, nurses, and health educators. A comprehensive 
        counseling center, staffed by psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed 
        therapists, offers individual and group counseling and includes a complete 
        career counseling center. Services are supported by registration fees 
        and are provided at no extra cost or for moderate fees covered by the 
        Student Health Insurance Plan. </p>
      <h5><a name="ship"></a>To use University Health Services, does my student 
        have to be enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP)? </h5>
      <p>All students are required to have major medical insurance to cover what 
        UHS does not &#8212; hospitalization, away-from-campus care, and some 
        specialty services. To meet this requirement, students automatically are 
        enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan. Some students choose to 
        waive SHIP enrollment, but your student can use all UHS services whether 
        or not he or she stays enrolled in SHIP.</p>
      <h5><a name="familyplan"></a>If my daughter already has insurance through 
        our family plan, do I need to buy the Berkeley-endorsed plan? </h5>
      <p>No, she can waive enrollment in SHIP by filling out an <a href="http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/students/insurance/waiver/welcome.shtml">online 
        waiver form</a> by the specified deadline. </p>
      <h5><a name="sick"></a>What if my student becomes sick and has to miss the 
        remainder of the semester? </h5>
      <p>You or your student should call the Social Services unit at the Tang 
        Center (510/642-6074), and a counselor will provide assistance.</p>
      <h5><a name="treatmentprograms"></a>Does UC Berkeley offer treatment programs 
        for alcohol and drug abuse? </h5>
      <p>Counseling, prevention, and education programs, support groups, medical 
        treatment, and other resources are available to assist students who have 
        <a href="http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/students/medical/alcoholanddrugs.shtml">alcohol 
        or drug-related issues</a> &#8212; or have friends or roommates with these 
        issues. </p>
      <h5><a name="depression"></a>My student seems depressed. Are there campus 
        resources to help? </h5>
      <p>Counselors at the Tang Center, home of University Health Services, can 
        <a href="http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/students/medical/depression.shtml">help 
        with concerns about depression</a>. Counseling and Psychological Services 
        at UHS employs a multicultural group of social workers, psychologists, 
        and psychiatrists who can discuss choosing majors, defining interests 
        and abilities, clarifying career goals, coping with personal crises, dealing 
        with relationships, or just college life. UHS services are partially funded 
        by fees, and some are offered at no additional charge. For information 
        by phone, call 510/642-9494.</p>
      <h5><a name="nightsafety"></a>Does the campus sponsor night safety programs?      </h5>
      <p>The UC Police Department operates a <a href="http://police.berkeley.edu/programsandservices/campus_safety/index.html">night 
        safety shuttle and escort service</a> that provide safe access to cars, 
        campus facilities, nearby homes, and public transportation. Students are 
        encouraged to be alert to suspicious behavior and to walk with a friend 
        on well-lit paths when out at night. </p>

	  <h5><a name="twofriends"></a>Can two friends room together?</h5>
      <p>Yes, we encourage students to indicate a roommate on their application 
        and carefully follow all of the directions. We make every effort to accommodate 
        roommate requests. However, it is more difficult to room students together 
        who have different admission status (e.g., a fall admit with a spring 
        admit or a freshman with a transfer student). Students in this situation 
        who are willing to accept a triple-occupancy space should <a href="mailto:kniffin@berkeley.edu">contact 
        Michelle Kniffin</a>, the assistant director for assignments in the housing 
        office. </p>
      <h5><a name="movein"></a>What can I expect on Move-In Day?</h5>
      <p>Campus residence halls offer lots of <a href="http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/welcome_to_cal.html">tips 
        for moving in</a> &#8212; from directions and transportation to campus 
        to checklists for equipping your room. You can call 510/642-4108 for answers 
        as well. </p>
      <h5><a name="movetime"></a>When must students move out of residence halls 
        at the end of a semester and when can they move in at the beginning of 
        a semester?</h5>
      <p>Students must move out of the residence halls by 10 a.m. one day after 
        finals end. (See the <a href="http://opa.vcbf.berkeley.edu/AcademicCalendar/calendar.cfm">academic 
        calendar</a> for finals schedules.) The residence halls are closed during 
        winter break and generally reopen one week before spring classes resume. 
        Continuing students must leave at the close of the fall semester, but 
        they do not need to move their belongings (some students prefer to remove 
        valuables like laptops, etc.). All students must move themselves and their 
        belongings out at the end of the spring semester.</p>
      <h5><a name="roommate"></a>What can I do if my son has a problem with a 
        roommate?</h5>
      <p>Although many long-lasting friendships are formed in the residence halls, 
        your student should not assume that his roommate will be his best friend. 
        Roommates should try to get to know one another and be respectful, honest, 
        and considerate. Residence hall staff work with students to develop a 
        roommate agreement, setting boundaries and clear expectations. They recommend 
        discussing needs and differences in lifestyles and values and, when necessary, 
        learning to work out compromises. If communication breaks down and problems 
        arise, your son should see the resident assistant on his floor. Staff 
        are trained in conflict resolution and will help your son with relationship 
        problems.</p>
      <h5><a name="fratsor"></a>How can we find out about fraternities and sororities?</h5>
      <p>Berkeley has 19 sponsored sororities and 38 sponsored fraternities. Members 
        are recruited to these Greek-letter organizations, usually in the first 
        few weeks of the fall semester. Information about individual sororities 
        or fraternities is available through <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/osl.asp">Campus Life and Leadership</a> (510/642-5171) or <a href="http://www.calgreeks.com">Cal 
        Greeks</a>.</p>
      <h5><a name="offcampus"></a>How does my student go about finding off-campus 
        housing?</h5>
      <p>Start at <a href="http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/calrentals.html">Cal 
        Rentals</a>, for housing counseling, listings, materials, and advice. 
        Part of the campus's Residential and Student Services Programs, 
        Cal Rentals can help your student formulate an effective housing search 
        strategy. Your student can also <a href="mailto:homeinfo@berkeley.edu">contact 
        Cal Rentals by e-mail</a> or phone at 510/642-3642.</p>

	  <h5><a name="campustour"></a>How can we take a tour of campus?</h5>
      <p>Free guided campus walking tours are offered daily. On weekdays, the 
        90-minute, student-led tours begin at the campus Visitor Center, 101 University 
        Hall (2200 University Ave.) at 10 a.m. Weekend tours begin at the Campanile 
        (Sather Tower) in the center of campus on Saturday at 10 a.m. and Sunday 
        at 1 p.m. For details, including directions and where to park, check out 
        <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/visitors">Visitor Services</a>. For a 
        spectacular view of the campus without the travel, <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/tour">take 
        our online tour</a>. </p>
      <h5><a name="hotels"></a>What hotels are located near the Berkeley campus?</h5>
      <p>There are many hotels, motels, and bed-and-breakfasts in and around Berkeley. 
        See our <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/calparents/guide/visiting/stay.html">visitor 
        guide</a> for a sampling of places to stay near campus.</p>
      <h5><a name="parking"></a>Where do I park when I visit campus?</h5>
      <p>Parking is at a premium in Berkeley, and regulations are strictly enforced 
        both on and around campus and in city lots. University parking lots and 
        campus spaces are reserved weekdays for permit-holders; the lots are open 
        to the public for a fee on evenings and weekends. Public parking lots 
        are metered or attended; all are fee lots. <a href="http://pt.berkeley.edu/park/public">Complete 
        parking information</a> is available online.</p>

	  <h5><a name="packages"></a>How can I send packages to my student in the 
        dorm?</h5>
      <p>Be sure to include the student's name, unit or building, room number, 
        street address, city, state, and zip code. Packages and deliveries are 
        held for pick-up in the mailroom of each residence hall, and your student 
        will be notified. It's a good idea to let your student know you 
        have sent something. </p>
      <h5><a name="cominghome"></a>How often should my son come home?</h5>
      <p>College is your student's time to grow and establish his own identity. 
        Discourage him from coming home too soon or too often. While it is hard 
        to know your student is lonely, homesickness is a natural and normal part 
        of leaving home and becoming independent. Bringing homesick students home 
        on weekends can inhibit their ability to develop new friendships and prolong 
        their adjustment to being away. </p>
      <h5><a name="parentsfund"></a>What is The Parents Fund?</h5>
      <p>State funding and student fees make up just a portion of UC Berkeley's 
        operating budget. Donations to <a href="/gifts/index.shtml">The 
        Cal Parents Fund </a>help bridge that financial gap by providing flexible 
        funds for the Chancellor to use where they are needed most &#8212; all 
        to benefit students. Families can <a href="http://givetocal.berkeley.edu/fund/?f=FX0120000">make 
        a gift</a> that will help fund freshman and sophomore seminars, undergraduate 
        research, the Library, the Career Center, classroom improvements, and 
        night safety programs, among many others. </p>
