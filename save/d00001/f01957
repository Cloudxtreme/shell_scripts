<H2>Goals</H2>

I attempted to create the holy grail:
<p>
	* Maintain low latency for interfactive traffic at all times
<p>
This means that downloading or uploading files should not disturb SSH or
even telnet. These are the most important things, even 200ms latency is
sluggish to work over.
<p>
	* Allow 'surfing' at reasonable speeds while up or downloading
<p>
Even though http is 'bulk' traffic, other traffic should not drown it out
too much.
<p>
        * Make sure uploads don't harm downloads, and the other way around
<p>
This is a much observed phenomenon where upstream traffic simply destroys
download speed. It turns out that all this is possible, at the cost of a
tiny bit of bandwidth. The reason that uploads, downloads and ssh hurt
eachother is the presence of large queues in many domestic access devices
like cable or DSL modems.
