<h1>POPS: Package Of the PackageS for FreeBSD</h1>

[English]<a href="pops-j.html">[Japanese]</a>

<p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

POPS is a package of the packages for FreeBSD, and can be compared to
`a distribution' in a context of the Linux community. In the *BSDish
tradition, administrators should install as many packages as they need
by their own hand. This is not only very tough for newbies, but also
for experts: for the former it is impossible to cover the vast
variation of existing softwares, and even for the latter, it is very
difficult to choose the appropriate software for their own purposes
and install them as many machines as they have.
<p>

POPS eases the pain in choosing and installing packages. All you have
to do is to run an install script. POPS, of course, is NOT a perfect
system, but is very much helpful for average users who have to carve
their ways by themselves.
<p>

The aims and objectives are the followings:

<ul>
  <li> to provide reference environment for beginners.
  <li> to provide a common environment for many users.
  <li> to provide easy way to duplicate FreeBSD boxes.
</ul>

The aims and objectives are NOT the followings:

<ul>
  <li> to produce a lot of newbies who are eternally newbies.
  <li> to provide the GUI environment which is similar to MS Windows.
  <li> to make a money by selling the distribution.
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

If you try POPS, you only have to prepare for more than 3.5GB free disk space
in a
/usr partition. The current version of POPS requires about 2.5GB
itself, i.e. the total amount of the disk spaces /usr needs is, even
in addition to the X-user distribution, over 3GB. However, you cannot
compile a kernel, install additional packages, in this case. We recommend
you to allocate at least 4GB for /usr.

<ol>
  <li> Install FreeBSD 4.9 (or version which corresponds to POPS)
  <ul>
    <li> Please take care to install XFree86 4.3.0 cleanly. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Obtain CD-ROM image of POPS and burn it.
  <li> Mount the CD-ROM.
  <li> run ./install in the directory 
</ol>

qmail are not included. If you wish to use these packages, install
them by yourself via ports.
