<dl>
<a name="aa"></a>
<dt>Does this really work?</dt>
<dd>Yes it does, very simply and very easily.</dd>

<a name="ab"></a>
<dt>Do I need to change my existing IPv4 web site?</dt>
<dd>No, your existing web site is not touched in any way, that's the
beauty of Instant6!</dd>

<a name="an"></a>
<dt>How long can I keep my IPv6 address?</dt>
<dd>
Forever! It's permanent.</dd>


<a name="aj"></a>
<dt>Will anyone else get my IPv6 address?</dt>
<dd>
The IPv6 address we issue you under Instant6 is exclusively yours
to use. It will never be assigned to any other website.
</dd>

<a name="ao"></a>
<dt>Does Instant6 use tunnels?</dt>
<dd>
No, Instant6 services are fully natively connected to both the IPv4 and
IPv6 Internet. There are no tunnels involved in providing the service.
</dd>

<a name="al"></a>
<dt>What's IPv6 then?  </dt>
<dd>IPv6 is just a new version of the system that makes
computers visible to each other on the Internet. But it has many more
addresses and smarter capabilities: it's futureproofed. <a
href="http://www.ipv6now.com.au/primers/IPv6Primer.php"
target="_blank">More on IPv6...</a></dd>

<a name="am"></a>
<dt>Why should I care about IPv6 and IPv4?</dt>
<dd>The old system, IPv4, is running out of addresses, and its replacement IPv6
is being phased in.
<em>But if your website isn't IPv6-capable, IPv6 users just won't be able
to see it!</em> <a
href="http://www.ipv6now.com.au/resources.php" target="_blank">Other
benefits...</a></dd>

<a name="ap"></a>
<dt>Why isn't the Government doing something about it?  </dt>

In fact, Governments worldwide are <a
href="http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/infrastructure/docs/Endorsed_Strategy_for_the_Transition_to_IPv6_for_Australian_Government_agencies.pdf"
target="_blank">getting their own networks onto IPv6</a>. But that won't
make your website visible to the IPv6 Internet!

<a name="aq"></a>
<dt>But hasn't my ISP got IPv6 sorted out already? </dt>

Dream on.  Most ISPs are still in denial
about the need to shift their networks to IPv6, so they won't be able to help either.
And it's your online business at risk of losing IPv6 customers, not theirs.


<a name="ac"></a>
<dt>How do I know my website is really IPv6-enabled?</dt>
<dd>Here are some different ways to check that it's working:
<ul>
<li><b>Try a <a href="http://lg.he.net/" target="_blank">Looking
Glass</a></b> to
trace the route from an overseas site to your website's IPv6 address:
select a site, click Traceroute, put your new IPv6 address in
the IP field, click Probe, and wait a few seconds for it to complete.
This shows that your website is reachable via IPv6 over the global
Internet.</li>

<li> <b>Set up a <a href="http://ipv6now.com.au/order/tryorder.php"
target="_blank">FREE Try6 IPv6 tunnel</a></b> - it takes only a few minutes,
and will give your computer IPv6 access to anywhere in the world.  Once
this tunnel is working, simply put
http://[<em>your:new:ipv6:address</em>] into your web browser
(including the [ ]) and you'll see your website via IPv6.  </li>

<li> <b>Install the <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/590/"
target="_blank">'ShowIP' plugin</a></b> if you use the Firefox browser.
ShowIP puts the IP address of any site you are visiting on the bottom
right of the browser.  Once you have an IPv6 tunnel going, when you
access any IPv6 site (including yours) the IPv6 address will be
displayed.  </li>

</ul>
</dd>

<a name="ai"></a>
<dt>How does Instant6 work?</dt>
<dd>

Instant6 works because it connects two worlds: the current IPv4 First
Internet and the new IPv6 Second Internet, used by devices such as the
latest generation (LTE, 4G) mobile phones. So, for example, when a 4G
mobile phone user wants to visit your website via IPv6, our Instant6
server responds on your behalf, recognising your unique Instant6 address
as belonging to your website.  It fetches your current content and
provides it to the IPv6 phone user in exactly the same way that an IPv4
call would be served.

</dd>


<a name="ad"></a>
<dt>Why doesn't my domain name work with IPv6?</dt>

<dd>Before this is possible, your new IPv6 address needs to be linked to
your existing domain name.  This is done by putting a new AAAA ('quad-A')
record in the domain name configuration file (DNS zone file) under the
secure administration of the ISP or Hosting Provider that hosts your
website. In your Instant6 welcome email we show you what you should ask
your provider to enter in their DNS zone file, e.g.  <em>bertsflowers.com
IN AAAA 2406:a000:6::c017 </em> </dd>

<a name="ah"></a>
<dt>What if my ISP/Hosting Provider can't do IPv6 Domain Name Services?</dt>

<dd>
If your
ISP is not capable of providing you with IPv6 DNS services, then to see
your site under IPv6 by <em>name</em> you will need to move it to <a
href="http://www.ipv6now.com.au/hosting.php" target="_blank">a dual-stack 
(IPv4/IPv6) hosting provider</a>. However, your site will always be
visible through its Instant6 numerical IPv6 address.
</dd>

<a name="ak"></a>
<dt>Instant6's current scope</dt>
<dd>Instant6 cannot be used with HTTPS websites that use secure certificate services. For that more complex service, websites need to be hosted 
on a <a href="http://www.ipv6now.com.au/hosting.php" target="_blank">dual-stack server</a>.
</dd>


<a name="ae"></a>
<dt>What new records will appear in my IPv4 website logs?</dt>

<dd>
In your normal IPv4 website logs you will see entries
from the Instant6 server that provides your content to IPv6 users. The address
of that server is 116.197.146.21.
</dd>

<a name="af"></a>
<dt>How do I find out who has visited my site via IPv6?</dt>

<dd>If you have subscribed to Professional Instant6, you will have
access to AWStats, a package that provides a complete breakdown of
the IPv6 traffic to your site: website visitors
under IPv6, daily, weekly, monthly and annual hits, bandwidth,
pages. It also shows origin of visitors, pages accessed, search keywords used,
and page errors.
</dd>

<a name="ag"></a>
<dt>What if someone else subscribes my web site to Instant6 without my
permission?</dt>

<dd>There is no possible way for anyone to hijack, mis-direct traffic or
gain back-door access to your site by subscribing it to Instant6 -
all they could do is pay for your site to
become accessible to IPv6 users! However, if such a situation should arise, and
you do not wish your site to be visible under IPv6,
please contact us directly, and after verifying your credentials we
will honour your wishes.</dd>
