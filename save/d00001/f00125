<p>Weight-Balanced Trees(or binary search trees of bounded balance) are binary search trees which can be used to implement
sets and finite maps (key-value store). This structure is widely used in
functional languages. For instance, Haskell uses this for
<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.3/html/libraries/containers-0.3.0.0/Data-Set.html">Data.Set</a> and
<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.3/html/libraries/containers-0.3.0.0/Data-Map.html">Data.Map</a>.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original weight balanced tree is invested by Nievergelt and
Reingold in 1972. Its weight is &quot;size + 1&quot;. The balance algorithm has
two parameters, delta and gamma.
They defined &lt;delta,gamma&gt; = &lt;1 + sprt 2, sqrt 2&gt;.
This algorithm and this parameter does not have bugs. That is, the
balance of a tree is always maintained.
However, since these parameter are not integer, implementation cost is
high.</p>

</ul>
<p>In 1991, Adams created a variant of weight balanced tree
for the programming competition organized by Appel. Its weight
is purely &quot;size&quot;. He defined (delta,gamma) = (3 or larger, 1)
in his SML implementations and papers.
The pair (delta,gamma) of &quot;wttree.scm&quot; is (5,1).</p>

</ul>
<p>While Campbell was re-implementing &quot;wttree.scm&quot; in 2010, he found a balancing bug.
In some cases, the delete operation on a given balanced tree breaks its
balance.
He also found Data.Map of Haskell is buggy and made <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4242">a bug report</a>.
To our tests, only (3,2) and (4,2) are valid.
So, all parameter choices by Adams are buggy.</p>
<p>We (<a href="https://yoichihirai.com/">Mr. Hirai</a> and <a href="http://www.mew.org/~kazu/">me</a>) mathematically proved in Coq that &lt;3,2&gt; is one
and only one interger solution for the original weight balanced tree
(not Adams's one).</p>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Dec 2010, <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/mit-scheme.git/plain/src/runtime/wttree.scm?id=89f138dfb7b37a4ac25d1046fb66583e6a6172c8">slib incorporated our patch</a>. (wttree.scm in slib 3b3 or earlier has this bug.)</li>
<li>In Jan 2011, <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/mit-scheme.git/commit/?id=fa7ec497241664b891e2b57c8330b47e6c8ede11">MIT/GNU Scheme incorporated our patch</a>. (wttree.scm in MIT/GNU Scheme 9.0.1 or earlier has this bug.)</li>
<li>Data.Map in the container package 0.3.0.0 or earlier has this bug. We would propose to incorporate our patch.</li>
