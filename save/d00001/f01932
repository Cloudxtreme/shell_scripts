    <h1>FreeBSD Foundation Board of Directors</h1>

    <p>The activities of the FreeBSD Foundation are directed by members
       of its Board of Directors.
    </p>

    <h2>Justin T. Gibbs, President.</h2>

    <p>Justin is a Senior Software Architect currently working on
       storage systems for Spectra Logic.  His past experience has
       ranged from office application development at Microsoft to
       embedded systems for general aviation aircraft at Avidyne.
       A member of the FreeBSD Development Team since 1993, Justin
       has contributed to many areas of the FreeBSD operating system,
       and is best known for his work on the SCSI subsystem.  After
       serving on the FreeBSD Core Team from 1995-2000 he created
       the FreeBSD Foundation to provide a non-profit framework for
       funding FreeBSD development and community support.
    </p>

   <h2>Erwin Lansing, Vice President.</h2>

    <p>Erwin works as a Network and System Engineer at
       DK Hostmaster A/S running the danish .dk ccTLD.
       He previously held a position as Network Systems Engineer
       at the Danish incumbent ISP, TDC and pil.dk, a webhosting
       company.  He joined the FreeBSD Ports Development Team in
       2003 and has been a member of the Ports Management Team
       since 2005.  He is mainly working on the package building
       cluster, creating and distributing ready-to-install binary
       packages of 3rd party software for FreeBSD, in addition to
       regression testing the integration of FreeBSD with 3rd
       party software projects.
    </p>

  
    <h2>Deb Goodkin, Secretary and Treasurer.</h2>

    <p>Deb has been with the foundation since August, 2006. She has
       spent 20+ years working in marketing, sales, and development
       of data storage devices. She earned an MSEE from the University
       of Santa Clara, and a BSCE from the University of California,
       San Diego.
    </p>

    <h2>Dr. Hiroki Sato, Director</h2>

    <p>Hiroki joined the FreeBSD Development Team in 2000. He has
       been working as a member of the Core Team since 2006 and the
       Release Engineering and Documentation Engineering Teams since
       2004.  His primary focus is maintaining the project's
       documentation and text processing software, and he is actively
       promoting FreeBSD in Asian countries by hosting BSD-related
       conferences.  He received a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering
       from Tokyo University of Science and now works as a researcher
       at the university.
    </p>

    <h2>Dr. Robert N. M. Watson, Director.</h2>

    <p>Robert is a University Lecturer in the Security Research Group 
       at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He leads a 
       cross-layer research team spanning computer architecture, compilers, 
       program analysis, operating systems, networking, and security; his 
       recent contributions include work in hybrid capability systems and 
       extensible access control. Prior to his PhD at the Computer Laboratory, 
       Dr Watson was a Senior Research Scientist at McAfee Research, where he 
       developed the kernel access control framework now used in many open-source 
       and commercial products including FreeBSD, iOS, Mac OS X, and Junos. He is 
       a member of the board of directors of the FreeBSD Foundation, and has been 
       an active contributor to the open-source FreeBSD operating system in the 
       areas of security, networking, and release engineering since the late 
       1990s.    
    </p>
   
    <h2>Dru Lavigne, Director.</h2>

    <p>Dru Lavigne is currently the Community Manager of the PC-BSD 
       Project, an open source desktop operating system based on 
       FreeBSD. She is also Chair of the BSD Certification Group 
       which maintains a global certification standard for system 
       administration on BSD based operating systems. She has been 
       using FreeBSD since 1996, has authored several BSD books, 
       and oversees the PC-BSD and FreeNAS&#8482; 8 documentation projects. 
    </p>

<h2>George Neville-Neil, Director.</h2>
<p>
George has been dabbling in the BSD world since his undergraduate 
days in the mid-1980s. He was granted his commit bit in 2004, 
and has served two terms on the FreeBSD Core team between 2006 and 2010. 
</p>

<p>
In 2011, he started organizing the semi-annual FreeBSD Vendor 
Summits that gather commercial customers of FreeBSD along with project 
members in order to facilitate the movement of technologies between 
the Project and its customers. 
</p>

<p>
George co-authored "The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD 
Operating System." His technical contributions are mostly within 
the FreeBSD network stack with occasional forays into other parts 
of the system. 
</p>

<h2>Dr. Marshall Kirk McKusick, Director.</h2>
<p>
Dr. Marshall Kirk McKusick writes books and articles, teaches
classes on UNIX- and BSD-related subjects, and provides
expert-witness testimony on software patent, trade secret,      
and copyright issues particularly those related to operating
systems and filesystems. He has been a developer and commiter
to the FreeBSD Project since its founding in 1994. 
</p>

<p>
While at the University of California at Berkeley, Kirk implemented
the 4.2BSD fast filesystem and was the Research Computer
Scientist at the Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group     
(CSRG) overseeing the development and release of 4.3BSD and 
4.4BSD. He earned his undergraduate degree in electrical
engineering from Cornell University and did his graduate   
work at the University of California at Berkeley, where he
