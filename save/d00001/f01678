<a name="what"><h3>What is ISOC-AU?</h3></a>
The Internet Society of Australia, ISOC-AU, was founded in 1996. It is a non-profit,
user-focused organisation which promotes development of the Internet in
Australia to <b>benefit the whole community, including business, academic,
professional, and private Internet users.</b>

<p>
<b>ISOC-AU is committed to the positive evolution of the Internet</b>.  It is
the Australian chapter of the worldwide Internet Society, ISOC - the
parent body of the Internet Engineering Task Force: a large, open
community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers
which actually creates the protocols and standards that are
fundamental to Internet operation.
<p>
Members of ISOC-AU are able to:
<ul>
<li> Have their say in submissions on public policy and critical Internet issues affecting Australia
<li> Stay informed with our mailing-lists
<li> Support ongoing international Internet development through ISOC and the IETF
<li> Receive reduced entry fees to meetings, conferences, and events held by our Organisational Members
</ul>
<p><br>

<a name="does"><h3>What does ISOC-AU do?</h3></a>
<b>ISOC-AU provides technically knowledgeable advice on Internet
development and public policy</b>.  It offers an environment in which
members may seek information, discuss issues, and provide input into
official policy submissions that the Society takes to industry and
government on the members' behalf.  Through parent body ISOC, members
also take part in international Internet policy development.

<p>
<b>ISOC-AU represents the interests of the users of the Internet</b>.  The
Internet industry in Australia is required to be self-regulatory: to
consult with and take into account the needs and concerns of all users,
including individuals, vendors and business interests.  ISOC-AU is
widely respected as the provider of the informed end-user voice that is
essential to this process.  Our Organisational Members represent more
than 40,000 Internet users at all levels of Internet industry, research
and infrastructure.

<a name="organ"><h3>How is ISOC-AU organised?</h3></a>

<b>Individual Members</b>: Anyone may join ISOC-AU as an individual
member (concession rates apply for students and pensioners).  Members
may use mailing-lists, contribute to submissions, be part of
parent-body ISOC, attend networking get-togethers, and receive reduced
fees to conferences. Members become part of a friendly, informed
network of people at all levels of Internet experience.

<p>
<b>Organisational Members</b>: Any group that uses the Internet may
join as an Organisational Member at grass-roots Foundation level, or
established Enterprise level.  Representatives of Organisational
Members have the same benefits as individual members.  The organisation
also receives access to multiple memberships, exposure on our Web site,
cross-promotion of relevant events, and may take part in ISOC-AU's
Advisory Council and special forums.

<p>
<b>Sponsors</b>: ISOC-AU sponsors show by their support a direct
commitment to the development of the Internet and gain the opportunity
to network with some of the most Internet-experienced people in
Australia.  They may take part in the Advisory Council, to offer
perspective and input into submissions.  Sponsors also receive a number
of memberships, marketing exposure at events and on the Society's
website, and may highlight their status as supporters of ISOC-AU in
their own marketing.

<p>
<b> Directors</b>: Members elect a board of twelve directors, who appoint
an executive director.  One-third of the board is rotated each year and
any member may stand for board election at the AGM.  Directors meet each
month via teleconference and at least twice a year in person.
