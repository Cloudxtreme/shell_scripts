<h2>Activity 2. Enabling</h2>

Activity 2 provided Enabling Tools such as <b>Business Case Scenarios</b>,
<b>ROI Evaluator</b>, <b>Transition Checklist</b>, and an <b>Easy Access
Device</b>, to help Australian businesses plan and deploy IPv6 in
cost-effective and efficient ways.  Development and testing in Activity 2 took
place in cooperation with small and medium sized enterprises working in
the construction industry. 

<br /><br />

<h5>Introduction</h5>
Every organisation has different priorities, management, clients, locations,
requirements, skills, complexity and infrastructure.  
<em><b>Ultimately, every organisation must decide for itself the value and
timing of a transition to IPv6</b></em>.
<br /><br />

IPv6 will unquestionably become part of Internet communications 'plumbing'
over the coming years: it has compelling technical advantages in scale,
flexibility and mobility. 
But organisations must time their transition to IPv6 to best advantage.  To
hold back and wait might be a good strategy for some businesses, but others may
find that if IPv6 is suddenly required, then urgent equipment upgrades and
experienced staff may cost them far more than if IPv6 had been implemented
slowly and carefully over time.

<br /><br />


For instance, much computing and network hardware is IPv6-capable
today, so a constructive approach might be to choose such hardware during
the normal business upgrade cycle, and systematically phase in IPv6 training
across the organisation.

 <em><b>However, successful transition to IPv6 will only be possible with
strategic understanding at boardroom levels, long-term planning at management
levels, and professional resources at technical levels.</b> </em>

<br /><br />


The requirements, risks and returns of IPv6 must first be 
understood before resources can be implemented.
The Enabling Tools below offer a sequence of analysis that organisations can 
work through before decisions are made on IPv6 deployment, and a device
to assist in IPv6 connectivity. (More detail on each Enabling Tool
is linked from the headings below.)

<br /><br />

 <h5><a href="business.php">1. Business Case Scenarios</a></h5>

The Business Case Scenarios offer different approaches to IPv6 implementation,
to help businesses strategically examine their own positions in regard to
developments in Internet technology.  Seven scenarios are considered:

<ol>
<li> The 'do nothing' case
<li> It's inevitable, may as well go with the flow
<li> Competitive differentiation
<li> Competitive protection
<li> Return on investment
<li> Known opportunities - understood and tangible
<li> Unknown opportunities - preparing fertile ground
</ol>


 <h5><a href="roi.php">2. ROI Evaluator</a></h5>

The intent of this application is to effectively estimate the financial impact
of IPv6 adoption on businesses in order to facilitate the uptake of the IPv6
protocol.  The application will calculate the value potentially delivered or
enabled by an implementation project by evaluating net present value, return on
investment, and payback period over a defined time period (nominally 15 years). 

<br /><br />

<h5><a href="transition.php">3. Transition Checklist</a></h5>

Every business needs to consider its own requirements in  
transition to IPv6. Below are some steps that will help in successful
deployment. Note that the actual phasing-in of IPv6 equipment is only one of
them - most steps refer to strategic decisions and activities that need to take
place across the entire organisation, not just in the technical area.

<ol>
<li> <b>Assess</b> business requirements, risks and benefits
<li> <b>Survey</b> existing network infrastructure
<li> <b>Educate</b> technical staff professionally
<li> <b>Resource</b> network and security infrastructure
<li> <b>Phase-in</b> and test IPv6-capable devices 
<li> <b>Inform</b> and set policies for general staff
<li> <b>Monitor</b> and maintain procedures and infrastructure
</ol>



<h5><a href="EAD.php">4. Easy Access Device</a></h5>

The prototype Easy Access Device provides infrastructure to allow IPv6
connectivity with a 'tunnel appliance' for small businesses and home offices.
It allows straightforward, inexpensive IPv6 connectivity, without
time-consuming and technically complex site-by-site deployments, and is
implemented on an open standards device.  

<br /><br />


In early 2007 testing took place with small and medium sized enterprises,
including <a href="http://www.buildersnet.com.au/">BuildersNet</a>, working in
the construction industry, fundamentally connected into a broad range of
businesses in the Australian economy.  By focusing initially on the needs of
SMEs, the IPv6 for e-Business project gained greater understanding of adoption
issues across a wide range of sectors.
