</h2>
<p>


This program plan outlines CAIDA's anticipated activities for
2010-2013, in the areas of research, infrastructure, and data
collection to support the research community.  For over twelve 
years, CAIDA has provided a neutral framework for cooperative
research, tool, and infrastructure development to support Internet 
measurement and analysis based on the best available empirical data.  
Our current research projects, primarily funded by the U.S. National 
Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Science and Technology Directorate, include both measurement-based and
theoretical studies of the Internet's core infrastructure, with emphasis 
on the health and integrity of the global Internet.
We are supporting DHS's PREDICT program with several projects:
macroscopic traffic data collection and analysis; advancing data 
disclosure control techniques and methods; and developing 
ethical guidelines for conducting cybersecurity research.
Our infrastructure activities include developing and deploying an 
active measurement platform that cost-effectively supports global 
Internet research and security vulnerability analysis. 
We also continue to lead and participate in tool development to
support measurement, analysis, indexing, and dissemination of data
from operational global Internet infrastructure. Finally, we will
continue our outreach activities, including our web sites, peer-reviewed
papers, workshops, blogging, presentations, and technical reports,
presentations.  </p>

</p>
<p>
CAIDA is involved in a variety of research activities spanning
many domains related to network science and engineering. We seek to
discover models that characterize fundamental behavior of
the Internet as an evolving complex system
and are capable of predicting salient aspects of future evolution. We also
aim to reliably measure and analyze the current state of the Internet in 
order to validate our theoretical research against empirical data.
Specific projects are listed below, with funding status summarized 
at the end of each section.

<p>
<b>Routing</b>







</p><p> 
<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> 

Routing information is the most basic and, perhaps, the most
complicated function that networks perform. Conventional wisdom states
that to find paths to destinations through the complex network maze,
nodes must communicate and exchange information about the status of
their connections to other nodes, since without some knowledge of
changing network connectivity, it is not possible to successfully
route information through the network.
</p>


<p>
In the Internet, this required inter-node communication makes routing
both expensive and fragile. The recent Internet Architecture Board
report on routing and addressing (RFC4984) identifies convergence
costs of deployed routing protocols as one of the most serious scaling
issues with the existing Internet routing architecture, aggravated by
explosive rates of routing table size growth. Worse yet, the required
number of messages for routing state to converge on Internet-like
topologies cannot scale better than linearly with network size for any
routing algorithm.
</p>


<p> 
Our routing research efforts aim to develop truly scalable routing
algorithms that do not require global knowledge of the network
topology. In this <a href="/funding/netse/">project</a>, 
funded by NSF's Network Science and Engineering (NetSE) program, 
we will apply our previously developed theoretical framework of 
hidden metric spaces (HMS) underlying real networks to investigate 
the efficiency of greedy forwarding mechanisms exploiting the 
structural properties of the Internet topology. 
Our research agenda builds on what we have already confirmed: 
HMSes do underlie real complex network topologies, including the Internet,
and make such networks naturally navigable. Even more impressive,
greedy routing paths in such topologies are almost always 
shortest, and successful with a high probability.  
Next, we will explore more sophisticated models of HMSes, find out
how nodes in real networks compute and compare their HMS coordinates,
and how network dynamics including link and node failures affect the 
efficiency of greedy forwarding.
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Currently funded tasks include:</u>

</p>

<ul>
<li> show that negatively curved (hyperbolic) HMS are the most congruent with
complex networks and explain their common structural properties; </li>
<li> prove that all greedy paths in hyperbolic spaces are shortest
and successful; </li>
<li> verify that HMS underlying real networks are hyperbolic
and measure their basic geometric properties; </li>
<li> construct embeddings of real networks into the identified hyperbolic spaces.</li>
</ul>





 
</li>

<p>
<b>Topology</b>







</p><p>


<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> 
We now critically depend on the Internet for our professional, personal,
and political lives - and yet our comprehension of its underlying
structure and dynamics remains disturbingly insufficient. Fundamental
characteristics of the Internet topology are perpetually challenging to
measure, research, and analyze, for technical as well as policy and economic
reasons. 

</p>


<p>
With previous NSF and DHS funding, we designed, implemented, deployed, 
and now operate <a href="/projects/ark/">Ark</a> - a secure 
platform capable of performing various types of Internet infrastructure
measurements and assessments. To improve our understanding of Internet
topology structure and behavior, we will integrate state-of-the-art
measurement data provided by Ark and our novel analysis methodologies 
including IP alias resolution techniques, conversion of IP/router to AS-level
topology graphs, AS taxonomy and relationship inference, geolocation of IP
resources, and various informative graph visualizations.
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Currently funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> collect <a href="/data/active/ipv4_routed_24_topology_dataset.xml">annotated macroscopic IPv4 topology data</a>;</li>
<li> improve and apply best available IP alias resolution techniques to build
router-level graphs of the Internet;</li>
<li> improve and apply best available AS relationship inference techniques to
create annotated AS-level graphs of the Internet;</li>
<li> conduct comparison of topology datasets obtained by different measurement
methods and at different levels of granularity;</li>
<li> develop software to merge router-level and AS-level graphs into annotated
dual Internet topologies;</li>
<li> analyze existing methodologies for geolocation of Internet objects and
augment our topology graphs with geographic annotations; </li>
<li> develop a generator to produce annotated dual Internet topologies 
for simulations;</li>
<li> improve the accuracy of our AS ranking service;</li>
<li> develop software and interactive visualizations enabling validation of
 our ranking inferences;</li>
<li> conduct a pilot study on integrating Ark topology measurements and real-time
BGPMON routing data;</li>
<li> expand <a href="/data/active/ipv6_allpref_topology_dataset.xml">collection of IPv6 topology data</a>;</li>
</ul>




<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Additional funds are needed to:</u> 

</p>

<ul>
<li> develop efficient IPv6 topology probing algorithms; </li>
<li> create packages of data about connectivity, routing and latency gathered
from a large cross-section of the global Internet targeted as educational 
aid </li>
<li> cross-validate source of topology and performance data from other projects, including the FCC's recently announced broadband measurement program. </li>

<b>Internet Economics</b>







</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u>  
The high-level objective of this research is to create a scientific
basis for modeling Internet interdomain interconnection and
dynamics. Specifically, we aim to understand the structure and
dynamics of the Internet ecosystem from an economic perspective,
capturing relevant interactions between network business relations,
internetwork topology, routing policies, and resulting interdomain
traffic flow. Existing models fail to capture the complexity of
network interactions,  or they are not parameterized with real-world data,
leaving both fields of network architecture and communications policy
research mostly groping in the dark while facing critical related
transitions.  
</p>


<p> We propose to create powerful, empirically parameterized
computational models, and enable broader validation than previously
possible. We will use measurements of interdomain traffic, topology
dynamics, routing policies and peering practices as input to our
detailed model of AS interconnection, and compute the equilibrium -- a
state where no network has the incentive to change its
connectivity. The key difference from previous modeling efforts is
that we parameterize each component of our model using real-world
measurements.  To validate our model, we will verify that it can
reproduce known macroscopic properties of the Internet AS topology as
well as known trends in Internet evolution, based on publicly
available financial and topological data. We will then use our model
to study various interconnection practices, the stability and dynamics
of interdomain links, and economic properties of the resulting
equilibrium.  </p>





<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Currently funded tasks include:</u> 

</p>




<ul>
<li> measure interdomain traffic characteristics directly from
different vantage points on the Internet;</li>
<li> measure structural characteristics of the Internet's interdomain
topology, its evolution over time, and the the economic implications
of these properties;</li>
<li> measure interdomain routing policies used by networks and the
economic incentives behind those policies;</li>
<li> measure policies used by different network types as inferred
from publicly available information such as peeringDB and Internet
Exchange Points (IXPs);</li>
<li> develop a simulator based on the developed evolution model and
parameterize it using results from the aforementioned measurement
studies; </li>
<li> validate our model of AS interconnection and dynamics by
reproducing known macroscopic properties of the Internet AS
topology;</li>
<li> use historical, publicly available financial and topological
data to verify that our model can reproduce known trends in the
evolution of the Internet;</li>
<li> use our model to answer various what-if scenarios about the
evolution of the Internet, such as the effect of changing traffic
patterns, changing price/cost structures, increasing popularity of
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and the increased use of
paid-peering.</li>

<b>Data Analysis and Sharing Methods to Support 
Security Research</b>







</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u>
The <a href="/research/security/telescope/">UCSD network telescope</a> is a portion of routed IP address space on which
little or no legitimate traffic exists (&quot;darkspace&quot;). 
Observing the unsolicited Internet traffic reaching such unoccupied 
address space, traffic which has increased dramatically over the last year,
allows visibility into a wide range of
security-related events, including misconfiguration, scanning 
by hackers looking for vulnerable targets, backscatter from random source 
denial-of-service attacks, and automated spread of malicious software such
as Internet worms or viruses. Learning more about the nature and 
characteristics of the still growing unsolicited traffic across the Internet,
and how it compares across different segments of address sapce,
will allow researchers to develop efficient mitigation strategies.
</p>


<p>
We aim to design and implement novel methods, protocols and tools 
to enable researchers to more effectively study current and 
emerging patterns in spurious and malicious traffic reaching 
observable darkspace. 
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">The funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> maintenance of the UCSD network telescope passive data collection
system;</li>
<li> collection, documentation, storage, and distribution of requested telescope data to vetted researchers.</li>
<li> build infrastructure to retain an approximately 30 day window of telescope data;</li>
<li> create front-end software for the telescope ongoing data collection to inform potential data users of interesting security events.</li>
<li> automate the <a href="/research/traffic-analysis/arin-heatmaps/">heatmap visualization technique</a> to display penetration of a given vulnerability into the IPv4 address space.</li>
<li> develop a scheme to classify the observed traffic into currently-known source types (e.g. DoS attacks, port or host scans, vulnerability scans of particular ports, etc.);</li>
<li> define sustainable policy for enabling real-time sharing of telescope data;</li>
<li> design and deploy a process for allowing multiple vetted researchers to run their analysis programs on the data within approximately an hour of its collection (&quot;moving-code-to-the-data&quot; type of approach);</li>
<li> enable tests for specific events/malware; </li>
<li> identify a set of attributes for hosts sending unsolicited traffic simple enough to allow real-time computation; </li>
</ul>

<b>Domain Name System (DNS) monitoring and analysis</b>








</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> 

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial component of today's
Internet. The top layer of the DNS hierarchy (the root name- servers)
is facing dramatic changes: cryptographically signing the root zone
with DNSSEC, deploying Internationalized Top-Level Domain (TLD) Names
(IDNs), and addition of other new global Top Level Domains (TLDs).
ICANN has stated plans to deploy all of these changes in the next year
or two, and there is growing interest in measurement, testing, and
provisioning for foreseen (or unforeseen) complications. 
With the past NSF funding, CAIDA has been collecting relevant DNS data 
and conducting research and analysis of DNS workload, stability, 
and performance. The resulting statistics serve as a baseline
for the impending transition to DNSSEC. 
</p>


<p> We seek to apply lessons learned from our global trace 
collection experiments, including improvements to future measurements 
that will help answer critical questions in the evolving DNS landscape.
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Additional funds are needed to:</u> 

</p>


<ul>
<li> collect data sets on DNS workload and performance and make them available
to other researchers;</li>
<li> using measurements and simulations, investigate implications and 
effects of new IDN ccTLD, DNSSEC, and IPv6 on DNS root server operation; </li>

<a name="infrastructure" id="infrastructure">II. Measurements, Data
Procurement, and Curation</a>
</h1>
<p>


</p>
<p>
The research community continues to suffer a lack of coherent data sets for 
cross-domain analysis of properties, performance, and dynamics of the
wide-area Internet. Since its foundation in 1998, CAIDA has pioneered
commodity Internet measurements and making the collected data available to 
researchers. We plan to continue our investment into data procurement to improve
the integrity of Internet science, while navigating the associated 
technology, legal, and ethical challenges. 
Current CAIDA infrastructure projects are listed in this section of the Program Plan.

<p>
<b>Archipelago (Ark) - Community Measurement Platform</b>






</p><p>


<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u>

The network research community has long acknowledged the
need for a community-oriented measurement platform that would achieve
greater scalability and flexibility than existing infrastructures,
encourage collaboration among traditionally independent groups and
allow previously unattainable groundbreaking research on
cyberinfrastructure itself. Now, in its third year of production,
the <a href="/projects/ark/">Archipelago (Ark)</a>
measurement platform has made measurable progress toward 
these goals.

</p>


<p>

Funded by NSF and DHS, Archipelago (Ark) is CAIDA's newest active measurement
infrastructure. It consists of several dozen standard PC's deployed around the
world, running software that allows them to operate as a coordinated secure 
platform capable of performing various types of Internet measurements.
We continue to upgrade and extend Ark in geographic scope as well as function.
The ultimate goal is to provide academic researchers with
an unprecedented laboratory in which to quickly design, implement, and easily
coordinate the execution of experiments across a widely distributed
set of dedicated monitors.
</p>



<p>
CAIDA researchers currently employ Ark to capture macroscopic topology
and performance data across a large cross-section of IPv4 and IPv6 address
space thus gathering the largest set of Internet topology data available
to the research community. Our probing tool for this project is
<a href="/tools/measurement/scamper/">scamper</a> developed
by Matthew Luckie from the <a href="http://www.wand.net.nz/">WAND</a> research group at the 
<a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/">University of Waikato Computer Science Department</a>. 
We will continue our collaboration with WAND on improving the
accuracy and integrity of topology measurement, inference,
annotation, and other analysis. 

</p>


<p>
We will also continue our collaboration with the 
<a href="http://spoofer.csail.mit.edu/index.php">MIT ANA Spoofer project</a>, which uses Ark infrastructure to assess macroscopic
trends in IPv4 and IPv6 source address filtering, e.g., of private or bogon
addresses, which should not be exiting appropriately configured networks.
Ark allows the spoofer project to more comprehensively identiy
networks that malicious users can compromise and misuse for purposes 
of obfuscating their behavior and circumventing existing security barriers.
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> management and maintenance of existing remote Ark monitors;</li>
<li> deploy 1 or 2 monitors per month, preferrably, in the countries that
do not have a monitor yet and other topologically interesting locations;</li>
<li> curate, archive, and distribute collected data;</li>
<li> consolidate, refine, and generalize our tool set for controlling
active measurement workflows; </li>
<li> develop a high-level API scripting language for writing
measurement programs;</li>
<li> introduce new experiments on Ark and develop new
partnerships with Internet researchers worldwide.</li>
</ul>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Additional funds are needed to:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> deploy more Ark monitors with IPv6 probing capabilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Bulk DNS lookup service</b>






</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u>
DNS annotations are valuable for many passive and active data analyses
as it often indicates whether a given IP address belongs to a router, 
home box, or a web server, as well as revealing organizational 
affiliation and geographical location information. Since host names
may change, it is important to obtain DNS meta-information as close as
possible to the primary measurements.  
</p>


<p>
Our previously developed bulk DNS lookup service executes DNS lookups 
in parallel with our macroscopic topology measurements, and archives 
them with timestamps to allow researchers to easily download 
corresponding topology and DNS data.
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> create an API for external researchers to use our bulk DNS
service</li>
<li> upgrade the system performance to handle increased data
sizes;</li>
<li> develop software to automatically annotate topology data with
hostnames.</li>
</ul>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Additional funds are needed to:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> enable lookups of IPv6 addresses in our bulk DNS service; </li>
</ul>  




 
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Passive Monitors</b> 







</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> 
Large-scale network empirical analysis, modeling, security, policy,
and architecture development all require access to real data collected
on Internet backbone links. Unfortunately, the expense of the
monitoring equipment (which must be upgraded every few years to
keep up with changes in the underlying infrastructure) exacerbated by
the general difficulty of coordinating deployment with remote volunteers
seriously impede our efforts to deploy additional passive monitors
on backbone Internet links or on public, research, and municipal networks.
Moreover, security, privacy, and legal concerns severely limit our options
for making already collected data available to researchers. 
In collaboration with the DHS PREDICT project (see below), we continue
to look for solutions that would enable representative passive 
measurements of the Internet traffic and sharing of the resulting data.
In the meantime we focus on tool development to support operators and
researchers with current and emerging passive measurement needs.
</p>


<p>

Currently, in collaboration with hosting sites, CAIDA helps support
data collection components on monitors in Internet exchange points
in San Jose, CA and Chicago, IL, where we regularly capture packet
traces from backbone and peering point links. These data have
significant policy restrictions on their use.

</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> add IPv6, DNSSEC, anonymization, aggregation, and 
netflow capabilities to the Coralreef traffic analysis software suite;</li>
<li> expand and improve dynamic web pages showing real-time traffic reports;</li>
<li> update the Coralreef report generator to include statistics of interest
for the NSF International Research Network Connections (IRNC) community;</li>
<li> help IRNC and other research community members install 
traffic monitors in their networks to support researcher access to data .</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Day in the Life of the Internet (DITL) </b>







</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> 

A significant increase in the quantity, quality, and accessibility of
empirical data supporting Internet research would help to answer many
open research questions regarding Internet workload, topology,
routing, performance, and economics.  Comprehensive measurements would 
enable researchers to uncover trends, validate simulations of new
architectures and protocols, and develop a baseline against which
to evaluate new network protocols or other architectural innovations. 
</p>


<p>
Over the past four years, CAIDA has worked
with <a href="http://www.dns-oarc.net/">DNS-OARC</a> and <a href="http://www.isc.org/">ISC</a> to coordinate annual <a href="/projects/ditl/">Day-in-the-Life of the Internet (DITL) collection events</a>.  
Our goal remains the establishment of periodic, synchronized, widely distributed
measurements delivering heterogeneous and diverse data sets, and the provision of
supporting tools, analyses, visualizations, and meta-data indexes. 
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">CAIDA seeks funding to support the following tasks:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> conduct annual DITL data collection events;</li>
<li> further refine measurement supporting software technologies;</li>
<li> develop strategic tools for analysis, visualization, and
indexing of resulting data sets;</li>
<li> develop educational materials based on DITL data;</li>
<li> organize series of hands-on workshops teaching examples of methodologically
sound DITL data analysis to faculty and students;</li>
<li> publish case studies derived from DITL data.</li>
</ul>

<b>Protected Repository for the Defense of 
Infrastructure Against Cyber Threats (PREDICT)</b> 





</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> 
Current data on Internet security threats and baseline Internet traffic 
are required for the development of hardware and software that would
protect against and mitigate the effects of these threats. Yet
obtaining such data is not only a technically challenging task, but 
also fraught with privacy, security, proprietary, and legal risks. Thus
there are few datasets available for the development and testing of 
defensive technologies, stunting the progress of security research. 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established the
<a href="http://www.predict.org/">Protected REpository for the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber Threats (PREDICT)</a> to provide vetted
researchers with current network operational data in a secure and controlled 
manner that respects the privacy, legal, and ethical concerns of Internet 
users and network operators. In collaboration with DHS and network researchers 
across the country, CAIDA personnel have helped develop and implement 
PREDICT processes and procedures.  CAIDA also serves as a PREDICT Data 
Provider and Host for a subset of CAIDA data approved by PREDICT, including
Internet topology data, older backbone passive traces (packet headers), 
and traffic data from the UCSD Network Telescope. 
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">The main funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> collection, documentation, and distribution of IPv4 topology
and derived AS topology datasets;</li>
<li> collection, documentation, anonymization, and distribution of
traces from a large-ISP backbone link; </li>
<li> collection, documentation, and distribution of <a href="/data/passive/network_telescope.xml">UCSD Network Telescope data</a>;</li>
<li> participation in the PREDICT Application Review and Publication
Review Boards;</li>
<li> providing feedback and advice on technical, legal, and practical
aspects of developing PREDICT policies and procedures.</li>
</ul>



 
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Privacy-Sensitive Data Sharing</b>







</p><p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u>
Concerns regarding end-user privacy and potential risks stemming from
unauthorized or unintended data disclosure present daunting challenges to 
researchers looking for access to real world Internet data. 
Adopting efficient, appropriate, and flexible disclosure control 
techniques is a promising first step toward enabling the kind of 
meaningful data access necessary for development and 
validation of scientific models.
</p>


<p>
We have developed a Privacy-sensitive Internet Data-Sharing framework that 
integrates privacy-enhancing technology with a consistent policy approach 
applying proven and standard privacy principles and obligations of data
seekers and data providers. The framework allows evaluation of data-sharing 
techniques along two primary criteria: (1) how they address privacy risks; and,
(2) how they achieve utility objectives. We will continue to develop, refine,
and popularize this Framework seeking to increase the volume of data available
to the network research, security, and development communities, facilitate
access to novel datasets, and work toward real-time situational awareness on 
current Internet usage and threats. 
</p>


<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">The main funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> investigate possible approaches to real-time data sharing balancing
privacy and utility; </li>
<li>educate policy community about Internet research, its advances 
and unsolved problems, and related data needs;</li>
<li> educate researchers about the current legal obstacles to data 
collection and sharing, and how to effectively apply privacy protection 
mechanisms in their research; </li>
<li> help design workshops and contribute to a documented set of 
guidelines for considering and addressing ethical issues in 
network and security research. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>DatCat - Internet Measurement Data Catalog</b>







</p><p>


<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">Motivation:</u> DatCat, the Internet
Measurement Data Catalog (DatCat), indexes Internet measurement
data, allowing researchers, faculty, and students to find, annotate,
cite, and share data.  The goals of the catalog are:

</p>

<ul>
<li> to facilitate searching for and sharing of data among researchers</li>
<li> to enhance documentation of datasets via a public annotation system</li>
<li> to advance network science by promoting reproducible research </li>
</ul>


<p>

Current development of the DatCat respository will be driven by
lessons we have learned over the past several years; fine-grained
metadata is unwieldly, proprietary database backend limits
sustainability, and penetration would benefit from momentum in a
narrow community.  We strongly encourage Internet researchers to
use DatCat to (1) find real data to help validate their research;
and (2) to share their data with others.

</p>



<p>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">The funded tasks include:</u>

</p>


<ul>
<li> continue ongoing indexing of newly collected CAIDA data; </li>
<li> design and implement versatile DatCat submission tools; </li>
<li> expand DatCat capabilities to enable cataloging tools in addition to data;
   <ul>
<li> streamline the user experience by creating standalone publications and collections objects; </li>
<li> implement an entirely web-based submission interface; </li>
<li> add support for more flexible granularity in annotations to allow annotating entire collections, subsets of files</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li> migrate to an open source solution for the backend database; </li>
<li> expand the DatCat community to Cybersecurity and other research fields;</li>
<li> hold workshops helping researchers to index their data in DatCat.</li>

<u xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">We are funded by NSF</u> to extend <span class="italic">CoralReef</span> with:
      <ul>
<li>parsing netflow output from routers;</li>
<li>increasing support for privacy protecting anonymization techniques;</li>
<li>improving IPv6 capabilities; </li>
<li>adding DNSSEC support.</li>
