The <a href="http://idefix.net/~koos/newsitem.cgi/1335723659">predicted change
from KPN to T-Mobile</a> took a bit longer than predicted but it has finally
happened. Network speed is now 1 mbit down and 32 kbit up according to
speedtest.
<p></p>
Somebody I spoke about it wondered whether there was a data subscription
included at all or this was the rate at which things could get expensive fast
but the T-Mobile business website confirms that this is the slowest data
subscription available from T-Mobile NL.

<blockquote>I checked for updates of <a href="http://ndpmon.sourceforge.net/">NDPMon,
an IPv6 neighbour discovery protocol monitor</a> and noticed I was way behind
the current times. I also found out it can now monitor multiple network 
interfaces in once instance of the program, so I can keep an eye on both
wired and wireless networks at home.
<p></p>
Do take the advice of using the 'learning' mode of NDPMon as mentioned in
the <a href="http://ndpmon.sourceforge.net/index.php?n=Doc.Configuration">documentation for NDPMon</a>. It makes getting the entire correct router advertisment
correct into the datafile correctly so much easier. Downside is you have
to run at a quiet time and after each IPv6 network reconfiguration.
<p></p>
It would also be nice if NDPMon would report on which interface certain
traffic was seen.
<p></p>
<strong>Update:</strong>
Ok, NDPMon still manages to warn about a router configuration it has learned
itself. I found a remark in the <a href="http://ndpmon.sourceforge.net/index.php?n=Doc.Configuration">NDPMon documentation/configuration page</a>:
<blockquote class="webquote">Under the tag addresses are listed the IPv6 global addresses of the router. This is not required for the tool to work properly, but can be useful is the router send NA messages for its global addresses (to avoid raising NA router flag alerts). </blockquote>
So I added the global IPv6 addresses of the routers, let's see if this
decreases the noise.

<strong>Update:</strong>
it helps when I remember the setup of the system: I installed the

Reception of 2 meter radio doesn't get worse/better during these tests.
According to the <a href="http://www.devolo.com/consumer/faqpr51-dlan-200-aveasy-network-kit.html">devolo dlan 200 faq</a> the devices work in the range
of 0 to 30 MHz with notches for HF amateur frequencies.
With the software defined radio I also see no change in the 2 meter band when
running bandwidth tests. Which doesn't say a lot: I can't even find the
output from <span class="callsign">PI3UTR</span> at 145.625 MHz in the output plot, even with a receiver
nearby receiving that same signal fine. The output plot does show APRS active
on 144.800 MHz.

<blockquote>Another thing I puppetized: setting static routes on redhat-like servers.
We have two rfc1918 ranges for management network so systems with a public
IPv4 address and a management IPv4 address need a static route to the
other half of the management network. Time for puppet which distributes the
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-*</tt> files and does an ifdown
and ifup of the affected interface. Using the variables from facter I can
find whether a host is on one of the management IPv4 ranges and on which

Seems edgecast has an IPv6 reachability problem from here (home, xs4all IPv6)
but not from other places. I can't reach the edgecast site either since it's
on their own network. Or at least I can't via the squid proxy, I can when
not using a proxy, since firefox has its own ideas about timeouts.
<p></p>
I tried to notify edgecast via e-mail and twitter.

Noted by others: <a href="http://dereenigne.org/site/wordpress-ipv6-issues">WordPress IPv6 Issues - dereenigne.org</a> seeing something more like PMTU

<blockquote>I recently got access to a Motorola SBV5121E cablemodem. No, I'm not 
switching to cable Internet access at the moment as ziggo still doesn't
offer fixed IPv4 addresses or IPv6 at all on consumer connections. But it was
interesting to give the cable modem a try.
<p></p>
If I am correct, this is the 'previous' generation cable modem. The
maximum speed on the ethernet interface is 100 Megabit where Ziggo now
offers subscriptions up to 120 Megabit.
<p></p>
When not connected to the cable network, the modem runs a small DHCP server
for IPv4 which gives out 192.168.100.x addresses. The management interface
is reachable via <tt>http://192.168.100.1/</tt>, username <tt>admin</tt>
password <tt>motorola</tt>.
<p></p>
When I connect the RF interface to the tv cable, it gets a link. In the
management interface I see Downstream frequency 186000000 Hz (186 MHz)
with QAM256 modulation. The upstream frequency is 36000000 Hz (36 MHz)
and the interface lists QPSK, 32QAM and 64QAM modulation, I guess the
fastest one with a reasonable error-rate is chosen. Downstream speed is
listed as 55.616 Megabit and upstream speed as 30.720 Megabit.
<p></p>
Interesting to see quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) used here, just
like in the DVB standards. I guess this is the best way to fit bits in a
broadcast channel.
<p></p>
Connected to the ziggo cable and running tcpdump shows arp traffic
originating from ziggo routers. Trying to cause traffic to ziggo IPv4
addresses from the outside shows arp for only one IPv4 address I tried,
not for lots of others. Which means either all those clients are active
(needing no ARP try needed) or one IPv4 address to the next being active in
separate broadcast domains.
<p></p>
I also ran tcpdump with the modem starting up disconnected at the cable
side. Absolutely no packet comes out on the ethernet interface.
<p></p>
First time I tried to get an IPv4 address from cable using DHCP while
connected it gave me a IPv4 address from the 198.18.0.0/15 range, a
range "reserved for benchmark tests of network interconnect devices".
When I tried to visit any website I got redirected to
<tt>www.ziggo-activatie.nl</tt> at 172.25.4.6 / 172.25.38.6 (which is
in RFC1918 space). This website identifies itself as activation site for
the provider, asking for a provisioning code and password.  I guess the
activation site will link cable mac and customer account in the databases
at the cable operator side.
<p></p>
A scan of the assigned network (a /24 out of 198.18.0.0/15) shows several
IPs in use all having the same MAC address 00:30:B8:xx:xx:xx (RiverDelta
Networks).  A search for RiverDelta Networks shows it is a maker of
cable modem termination systems and has been acquired by motorola.
<p></p>
When I tried it again it with the same cable modem it doesn't give me
an IPv4 address at all. An interesting change.
<p></p>
<strong>Update:</strong>
Later another Motorola SBV5121E cablemodem found its way to me. Trying
this modem gave me an IPv4 address via DHCP again and a new try at the
activation server so I could look up certain things described in this item
and update it.

My work mobile phone/mobile data subscription with the <a href="http://idefix.net/~koos/nokia-e71.html">Nokia E71</a> will change from KPN Netherlands to
T-mobile Netherlands soon so I decided to see if this means any change in
Internet speed and ran a speedtest. 1.35 Megabit/second down and 350
Kilobit/second up. Funny part: when I first tested this the speed was 1
Megabit/64 Kilobit. Somewhere an upgrade happened.

<blockquote>Yesterday somebody asked me about provider-independent addresses in  IPv6,
because of the old 'renumbering sucks' reason. At that moment I did remember
that there is a sort-of provider-independent option, but it is relatively
new and IPv6 purists frown upon it, so you probably will not get a
provider-independent allocation just because you don't like renumbering.
This does show the 'roots' of IPv6 being
in the time when classless inter-domain routing and aggregation were seen as
the best solution for routing table growth. But in the end: renumbering is
not so nice, and can cause interruptions in internal reachability. With full
NAT and just one external address renumber operations never affect internal
services.
<p></p>
But, later I remembered there is a solution in IPv6 for this, because it is
possible to configure multiple addresses on any interface in IPv6,
and outgoing traffic will prefer to reach a service on the same class
of address, with a preference set for each 'type' of address, as listed
in <tt>/etc/gai.conf</tt> in Linux. And there are equivalent tables in
other operating systems.
<p></p>
The solution is: assign all clients both a 'unique local'
and a 'global' IPv6 address. The 'global' IPv6 address is the one
which 'may change'.  When announcing both address ranges via the
router announce protocol, clients will configure both types.
More about unique local addresses in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address">Unique local address - Wikipedia English</a> but the important here is that
they are in the <tt>fc00::/7</tt> IPv6 address range.
<p></p>
Publish the <em>internal-facing</em> services, such as file-servers,
authentication-servers and time-servers with their unique local
address and the <em>external-facing</em> services such as web-servers with
their global address. Yes, some services will have both type of address.
Views in DNS will help you hide those internal-only services.
<p></p>
Nice theory, but I had to test this! So I calculated an IPv6 unique local
address range using bits of <a href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193">RFC 4193</a>
Officially, <tt>fd00::/8</tt> is the part in use for 'prefix generated
from random numbers', but I tested with an address in the range
<tt>fc00::/8</tt>. Little oops and being eager to test things there on my part.
I configured <tt>radvd</tt> accordingly in <tt>/etc/radvd.conf</tt>:
<pre>
interface eth0.3
{
   AdvSendAdvert on;
   prefix ::/64 {
                AdvOnLink on;
                AdvAutonomous on;
                AdvPreferredLifetime 604800; 
                AdvValidLifetime 2592000;
   };
   prefix fc5c:2186:e460:2::/64 {
                AdvOnLink on;
                AdvAutonomous on;
                AdvPreferredLifetime 604800; 
                AdvValidLifetime 2592000;
        };
   RDNSS 2001:980:14ca:42::694 {
   };
};   
</pre>
The prefix :: line is to automatically copy the assignment which <tt>dhcp6c</tt>
in prefix-delegation mode adds to it.
<p></p>
This causes the correct configuration on a client:
<pre class="commandlog">
# <strong>ip -6 addr ls dev wlan0</strong>
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
    inet6 fc5c:2186:e460:2:21f:e1ff:fe45:2894/64 scope global dynamic 
       valid_lft 2591560sec preferred_lft 604360sec
    inet6 2001:980:14ca:2:21f:e1ff:fe45:2894/64 scope global dynamic 
       valid_lft 2591560sec preferred_lft 604360sec
    inet6 fe80::21f:e1ff:fe45:2894/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</pre>
I also had to configure the unique local address range on the
<a href="">home router/server</a>, both as a 'service' IP and a 'network
interface' IP. IPv6 services live on eth0.42, the interface to the wireless
network is eth0.3.
<pre class="commandlog">
# <strong>ip -6 addr add fc5c:2186:e460::694/128 dev eth0.42</strong>
# <strong>ip -6 addr add fc5c:2186:e460:2::1/64 dev eth0.3</strong>
</pre>
<p></p>
And now I added a service with both type of addresses to DNS, and it works:
<pre class="commandlog">
$ <strong>host resolver</strong>
resolver.idefix.net has IPv6 address 2001:980:14ca:42::694
resolver.idefix.net has IPv6 address fc5c:2186:e460::694
$ <strong>host www.google.com resolver</strong>
Using domain server:
Name: resolver

Aliases: 

www.google.com is an alias for www.l.google.com.
www.l.google.com has address 209.85.147.104
www.l.google.com has address 209.85.147.105
www.l.google.com has address 209.85.147.106
www.l.google.com has address 209.85.147.99
www.l.google.com has address 209.85.147.147

www.l.google.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:400c:c01::63
</pre>
That is.. after I added the home unique local range to the acl in
<tt>named.conf.options</tt>. Which confirms the source address of the
unique local range is used. For a service which shows no unique
local address, the global address is used:
<pre class="commandlog">

www.l.google.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:400c:c01::63
</pre>
Now on documenting this I wonder what happens when radvd reconfigures itself
and sees 2 addresses, one of which it is to pick up and one of which is in
its own configuration. For now, this works. This may become unstable when the
global address changes, which means <tt>radvd.conf</tt> will have to be
generated in a more robust way from the prefix information found by
<tt>dhcp6c</tt>. <em>Learned: yes, this breaks when the global IPv6 address is removed
by <tt>dhcp6c</tt></em>.
<p></p>
<strong>Update:</strong>
This even works with a Linux-based router when the clients only have a
global IPv6 address and the services are reachable on unique local
addresses.
<p></p>
<strong>Update:</strong>
A few weeks later the Internet connectivity was shortly interrupted, which
means <tt>dhcp6c</tt> removes the global IPv6 addresses from the interfaces.
So <tt>radvd</tt> started advertising the <tt>fc00::/7</tt> address twice.
To fix that both advertised addresses have to be in <tt>radvd.conf</tt>.

<blockquote>At work we found a set <a href="http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP7920">APC AP7920 switched rack PDUs</a>.
A power distribution unit with a console / telnet / ssh / web interface.
But they didn't accept the DHCP offers at work, I found out from the
documentation they need a vendor specific dhcp option set. Which I can
disable in the configuration, after I get access via the network (the
serial access requires a special cable).
<p></p>
DHCP in <a href="http://idefix.net/~koos/homeserver-greenblatt.html">homeserver greenblatt</a> to the rescue. Added to the configuration of ISC DHCP server:
<pre>
option apc-vendor-cookie code 43 = string;
option apc-vendor-cookie 01:04:31:41:50:43;
</pre>
and the unit accepts the DHCP offer and I can switch that option off in the

Including the option to delay power-on of each outlet to avoid high power
surges and dependency problems.

I guess my laptop uses link-local IPv6 addresses for the first few dns
queries. Strange, because it only knows the address of the resolver because
it has received a router announcement. The most logical explanation is that
the system is still trying to detect duplicate addresses before actually
assigning the global IP, but DNS traffic is already going out because some
script in my browser is very anxious to fetch updates.
Anyway, configuring the resolver to
