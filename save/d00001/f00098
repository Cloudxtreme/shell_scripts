<p class="tb">Cyber Kansai Project is a joint research consortium among commercial sectors and academic entities in Japan. Its research topics are focused on leading-edge technologies for the next generation Internet. Our major activities are on both technology development and its pre-commercial deployment.</p>
<p class="tb">The project was established in 1996 by major members who developed and operated the Internet system for a top-level APEC conference held in Osaka in 1995. Currently, over 30 members from commercial sectors, university, and several government divisions are involved as our project members. The coverage of our activities are from development of fundamental technologies for the broadband Internet infrastructure to deployment of leading-edge applications and services on the Internet in the near future. Since 1997, our activities has been expanding beyond Kansai area in Japan. We have several partners such as WIDE Project, JGN (Japan Gigabit Network) Project led by Ministry of Post and Telecom (MPT), and we are now conducting many experiments with these partners. In 1999, our project has been an MoU member of Internet2 Consortium in US for accelerating deployment of new technologies developed by our project. This means that Cyber Kansai Project is now opening the door to international research collaborations with many universities and research laboratories in the heart land of the Internet technologies. Furthermore, our project is widely recognized as a technical group for providing the Internet broadcasting and video archive services at United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Changes held in Kyoto (Japan) in 1997 and Buenos Aires (Argentina) in 1998.</p>
<p class="tb">Our project also provides the live Internet streaming of the Koshien tournament, national high school baseball tournament, in order to verify large-scale traffic control technology.</p>
<p class="tb">Our test-bed network is constructed over 10Gbit /s class wide area networks, and it interconnects our major research units scattered over Kansai areas such as Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and Nara in Japan. With this test-bed network, we can conducts various experiments for fundamental IP technologies as well as broadband multimedia applications. Moreover, our test-bed network is interconnected with other research networks such as WIDE Internet, AI3 Projects test-bed network, and JGN. With this test-bed environment, many research output has been created through our activities. </p>
