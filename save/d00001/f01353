	<p>
		This is my personal homepage containing all kinds of tidbits that
		you might not want to know about me.
		See the <a href="bio/">Biography</a> page for a more serious summary.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://unfix.org">unfix.org</a> is my digital playground and digital home,
		it carries the stuff I produce and like to pass along to the rest of the internet.
	</p>

	<p>
		My nickname has been 'Fuzzel' since around 1989 which comes from
		my cat who <span title="She laid to rest in peace the night of 2nd November 2003 at age 16">was</span>
		named <a href="http://gallery.unfix.org/pussycam/">Fuzzy Wuzzy</a>.
		The nick thus dates back to the 'good old' Amiga and <a href="http://scene.org">Demoscene</a> days.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of my mottos is "It's good to be evil" or otherwise said "Sometimes it is right to do the wrong thing".
		Great food and computing recipes alike have been discovered by accidentally letting it stew a bit
		longer, adding too much salt or crossing the beams as such bad things are not always a contrary to good,
		especially when one keeps in mind from which point of view one is looking from.
	</p>

	<p>
		Something which seems to go wrong a lot is the pronunciation of my name,
		which is not as odd as it is a Dutch name and except for the Netherlands
		it doesn't seem to be a very common name. In French there is a more or
		less similar name "Jerome".
		If you want to know how you pronounce it 'correctly', you can listen to
		the following wav file: <a href="jeroen.wav" title="How to pronounce Jeroen (not my own voice;)">How to pronounce Jeroen (y&#601;-ROON)</a>.
		I found out that people seem to find it easy to pronounce it by saying
		"Your Room" but then with an 'n' in the end, this comes pretty close already
		to the real pronunciation.
		Don't worry if you can't pronounce it properly, I am already very pleased that
		most people know my name and bind it to positivity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Please follow this principle in order to avoid non-productive arguments
		with me: "Directly say what you want and mean, explain what is wrong,
		along with reasoning". I believe that it is very important to explain
		arguments as we are not necessarily always on the same line.
