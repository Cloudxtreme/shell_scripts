<P>
Setting up a machine as a NIS-client, you need to know the NIS-domain's
name, into which the machine is about to belong. This domainname has
nothing to do with the machine's DNS-domainname, it's just a unique
identifier for all the machines in the same NIS-domain to know them they
belong together (and to a certain server).

</P>
<P>
Do the following steps to setup a machine as NIS client:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>Domainname:

First, put the NIS-domain's name in <TT>`/etc/defaultdomain'</TT>.


<PRE>
echo our.nis.domain &#62;/etc/defaultdomain
</PRE>

<LI><TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> (and friends):

Put a line in the password file with the login-name consisting of a
single <CODE>+</CODE> and all the other fields empty. 


<PRE>
+:::::::::
</PRE>

This line tells the programs reading <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> to look for more
entries using NIS.  (Use <CODE>vipw</CODE> to edit, as usual. No editing of
<TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> by hand!)

<LI><TT>`/etc/group'</TT>:

Also, to enable programs scanning through <TT>`/etc/group'</TT> for getting
the NIS' <TT>`group'</TT>-file, add the following line to <TT>`/etc/group'</TT>:


<PRE>
+:::
</PRE>

<LI><TT>`/etc/resolv.conf'</TT>:

Add a line saying "<CODE>lookup yp</CODE>" to <TT>`/etc/resolv.conf'</TT>, if you
want to use DNS too (for hosts not in the <CODE>hosts</CODE> NIS-map, make the
line look like "<CODE>lookup yp dns</CODE>". Please see <CODE>resolv.conf</CODE>(5) for a
more detailled description.

<LI><TT>`/etc/rc'</TT>:

You'll have to uncommet a few lines in <TT>`/etc/rc'</TT>, please refer to
section <A HREF="nwf_38.html#SEC38">3.5.2 <TT>`/etc/rc'</TT></A>.

<LI><TT>`/var/yp'</TT>:

Create the directory <TT>`/var/yp'</TT>:


<PRE>
# mkdir /var/yp
</PRE>

<LI>Reboot:

Restart your system to take all the changes into effect and to start the
NIS-client daemon.

<LI>Check!

Try if everything is ok:


<UL>
<LI>See if you're connected to the right (or any) NIS server:


<PRE>
ypwhich
</PRE>

<LI>Try to get the NIS-server's <TT>`passwd'</TT>- and <TT>`group'</TT>-file:


<PRE>
ypcat passwd
ypcat group
</PRE>

<LI>If all this works well, try to see if your system also scans the

NIS-<TT>`passwd'</TT> properly, not only the local <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT>. Do
this by logging in as a user only kept in the NIS-<TT>`passwd'</TT> and not
in <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT>. 
</UL>

</OL>
