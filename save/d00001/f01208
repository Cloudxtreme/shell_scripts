<center><h2>Usage conditions</h2></center>
<p>
You are free to use cryptlib subject to the restrictions given below.
</p>
<table>
	<tr><td valign=top><img src="img/blob.gif"></td>
	<td>
If you use cryptlib, you must give the authors credit in your software and/or
documentation.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign=top><img src="img/blob.gif"></td>
	<td>
If you make any changes to the code, you should send a copy of the changes to
the author to allow them to be integrated into the code.  This is to allow a
central consistent version to be maintained.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign=top><img src="img/blob.gif"></td>
	<td>
Any software you create with this code may not be merely a set or subset of
cryptlib, with or without minor added functionality or a different interface.
In particular you can't distribute cryptlib (or any modified form of it) as
your own encryption product.  This is to stop people adding their own wrappers
and selling it as "their" encryption product.

<p>
cryptlib is distributed under a dual license that allows free, open-source use
under a GPL-like license and closed-source use under a standard commercial
license.  In addition, cryptlib is free for use in low-cost, non-open-source
applications such as shareware, and for personal and research use.  Exact 
terms are given at the bottom of this page.
</p>

<p>
cryptlib contains contributions from various open-source developers, see the
acknowledgements section of the manual for details.

<center><h2>Downloading cryptlib</h2></center>

<p>
The current cryptlib release is
<a href="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/crypt/cryptlib/cl342.zip">cryptlib 3.4.2</a>,
with a
<a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/cl342.zip">mirror</a> if there's a
problem with the main download site.  
<!-- Re-enable for non-betas 
In addition the
<a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/beta.zip">cryptlib 3.4.1 beta</a> 
contains the latest code updates for people who need a particular recent fix 
for a problem.  
Re-enable for non-betas -->
cryptlib includes a 330-page
<a href="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/crypt/cryptlib/manual.pdf">user's guide
and manual</a> (with a
<a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/manual.pdf">mirror</a> available)
in PDF format, this is distributed separately from the code.  You can also get 
the documentation in
<a href="http://www.thekelvins.dsl.pipex.com/dk/cryptlib_help_files/cindex.html">Windows 
help format</a> (conversion performed by David Kelvin).
<!--
The <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/snapshot_manual.pdf">manual for
the current snapshot</a>, with a
<a href="http://www.mfn.org/~pgutmann/snapshot_manual.pdf">mirror</a>, matches
the current cryptlib snapshot.  
and in particular if you're going to print off the entire 420 pages, it'd be
best to use the 
<a href=" http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/snapshot_manual.pdf">snapshot
manual</a> for this since this is the most current version of the
documentation.
-->
</p>

<p>
cryptlib is distributed in standard Zip format and can be extracted on
virtually all target operating systems.  Before working with it, you should
read at least the Installation section of the manual, which covers details on
installing the software on different platforms (under Unix you need to unzip
with the -a option).
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Sami Tolvanen and CAI there is a
<a href="http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/cl_ui.zip">cryptlib ActiveX control
</a> available that can be used with Visual Basic and other languages.  This
location also contains the cryptlib user interface components, which provide a 
key/certificate generation wizard and certificate viewer.  Wolfgang Gothier 
has a web page with <a href="http://cryptlib.sogot.de">Visual Basic and 
Delphi add-ons for cryptlib</a> that provide more VB- and Delphi-like 
interfaces than the standard one, as well as sample code in VB and Delphi.
For people interested in using cryptlib for SMTPS with services like Gmail,
Mike Trader has created an <a href="http://www.coastrd.com/smtps">overview of
SMTP/SMTPS and using cryptlib to implement it</a></p>.

<p>
cryptlib is distributed under a dual license that allows free, open-source use
under a <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/license-list.html">GPL-compatible

GPL-compatible license (a.k.a. the 
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/download/oslicense.html">Sleepycat 
license</a>) is given below.  A good

background behind the Sleepycat license</a>, which also applies for cryptlib, 
is also available.

<p>
If you're unable to comply with the above license then the following, alternate
usage conditions apply:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Any large-scale commercial use of cryptlib requires a license.  "Large-scale
commercial use" means any revenue-generating purpose such as use for 
company-internal purposes, or use of cryptlib in an application or product, 
with a total gross revenue of over US$5,000.  This allows cryptlib to be used 
in freeware and shareware applications, for evaluation and research purposes, 
and for non-revenue-generating or personal use without charge.  In addition the
author reserves the right to grant free licenses for commercial use in special
cases (for example where there is a general benefit to the public), contact the
author for details if you think you qualify.
</p>
<p>
For information on commercial use, there is a 
<a href="http://www.cryptlib.com/cryptlib_brochure(Jan07).pdf">cryptlib 
brochure</a> available in PDF format.

<center><h2>cryptlib support</h2></center>

<p>
There is a very low volume mailing list available that covers cryptlib
development and usage and implementation details.  To subscribe,
<a href="mailto:cryptlib-request@mbsks.franken.de?Subject=Subscribe cryptlib">
send mail to the list administrator</a> with the word "subscribe" in the
message body. You should receive a reply informing you that you've been added
to the list.  General questions on cryptlib are answered in the
<a href="faq.html">cryptlib FAQ</a>.  You can also
<a href="http://news.gmane.org/thread.php?group=gmane.comp.encryption.cryptlib" target="_blank">
access the list via the web</a> or
<a href="nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.cryptlib" target="_blank">as 
a newsgroup</a> (note that this is a one-way gateway <i>from</i> the mailing
list, you can't post to the list from the web/news interface but have to
subscribe to the list by following the instructions above).  An
<a href="ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/crypt/cryptlib/archives/" target="_blank">archive 
of older mailing-list postings</a> is also available.
</p>

<p>
cryptlib 3.3.3 (and by extension all earlier versions) has been end-of-lifed. 
Anyone who has a support contract for cryptlib version 3.3.3 or older will 
continue to receive support until the contract is up for renewal, after which 
you must upgrade to the current 3.4.x release.  Anyone without a support 
contract will no longer be able to receive support for 3.3.3 or earlier 
versions.
