<h2>Background</h2>
<h4>1. IPv6: a Strategic Need for Australia</h4>

Two major international market opportunities are emerging related to IPv6-based
next-generation Internet capabilities.  In North Asia, plans for major civilian
rollout of IPv6-based technologies are already in place, including e-business
and consumer electronics applications.  In North America and Australia, major
commitments have been made for the development of a new generation of
IPv6-based infrastructure that will support the information requirements of
defence operations and extend to interactions with defence supply industries.

<br /><br />

In North Asia, plans have been progressing for implementation of IPv6 for
civilian applications.  Three major trading partners of Australia have taken a
strong interest in IPv6 implementation: South Korea, Japan and China.  The
South Korean IT839 policy, issued by the Ministry of Information and
Communications, mandates civilian implementation of IPv6 by 2010 as a building
block in the development of u-Korea (ubiquitous information society).  

<br /><br />

In Japan, the WIDE Project and the IPv6 Promotion Council have been supporting
IPv6 demonstration activities since 1992, with Prime Ministerial endorsement
from 2000.  Key aspects of IPv6 infrastructure were expected to be operational
by 2006.  China has been working to significantly upgrade its ICT capabilities
in the lead-up to the 2008 Olympic Games, and there has been a strong effort
around IPv6 with the development of four new research and education networks.

<br /><br />

The defence community in Australia and overseas has been discussing potential
for building a more powerful information capability for its operations.  Much
of this discussion has focused on a concept of 'network-centric warfare'.  In
August 2003, the Australian Defence Department participated an industry
briefing on the topic of 'Integrated Planning within Defence - Now and in the
Future'.  This seminar emphasised the defence interest in longer term planning,
dialogue with industry and the capacity to overcome lack of interoperability of
systems.  At the first Australian IPv6 Summit in November 2005, the Australian
Defence Department announced a date of 2013 for implementation of IPv6 based
technologies.

<br /><br />

The USA Department of Defense has also developed an interest in
interoperability.  In June 2003, it circulated an unclassified memo identifying
2008 as the date for all equipment purchased to be IPv6 enabled.  In December
2004, further discussion of this topic occurred at the USA IPv6 Summit held in
Washington DC (www.usipv6.com).  At this event, all four USA military services
provided implementation plans for IPv6 by 2008.  This event continued the
approach of the Australian session of seeking unclassified discussions with
industry for development of new technologies.  

<br /><br />

Discussions of network-centric warfare concepts have continued in Australia.
For instance, the conference 'Meeting the Challenges of Warfare in the
Information Age' was held on November 24 - 25 2004, at the Australian Defence
Force Academy organised by IQPC Australia.

<br /><br />

Australian businesses need to have access to effective IPv6 infrastructure in
order to maintain interoperability with our major international trading and
strategic partners, including the important defence supply sector.  In
particular, this project will focus on enabling rapid adoption of IPv6 based
technologies for early-adopter businesses to ensure maximum interoperability
with our major trading partners. 

<br /><br />

<h4>2. Project Aims</h4>

The IPv6 for e-Business project conducted collaborative industry-based
activities to accelerate the adoption of IPv6-based business-to-business (B2B)
e-commerce solutions across a wide range of industry sectors, especially to
build the capacity of SMEs to form clusters and to allow early adopter
Australian businesses to participate advantageously in international trade and
supply chains.

IPv6 offers business advantages such as: 
<ul>
<li> Massively increased address space for increased scale of networking,
particularly of devices and potentially linked to RFID technologies

<li> Extension of Internet interoperable capabilities, particularly linked to
mobile devices such as phones 

<li> Compliance with government mandates, particularly in the US, Europe, Japan,
China and Korea, to implement IPv6

<li> Ease of implementation through autoconfiguration

<li> Security ease of implementation at the packet layer

<li> Direct addressing of all devices, without the need for NAT complexity

<li> Increased potential for remote sensing
</ul>

The IPv6 for e-Business project built business tools, promoted
awareness, and assessed the potential for test-bed applications to
demonstrate the effectiveness of IPv6.  In particular, it provided:

<ul>
<li>  A map of software, services and technologies taking advantage of IPv6
<li>  Business models, tools and checklists for enabling business
<li>  An Easy Access Device to allow SMEs to use IPv6 with minimal cofiguration
<li>  Information resources for building awareness of IPv6
<li>  Development of the underpinning infrastructure to support IPv6 use
</ul>

In terms of improving industry awareness it built upon the foundation
created by the First Australian IPv6 Summit in 2005, supported by the Security
and Business Environment Branch of DCITA.  Specific activities included:
showcasing of rollout at Australian IPv6 Summit 2006, a
website, pamphlet and other documents; and business and e-commerce Seminars.

<br /><br />

The project has fostered the awareness and strategic takeup of IPv6 based
e-commerce solutions, within and across industry sectors, to deliver
sustainable economy-wide returns and contribute to increased competitiveness.

<br /><br />

<h4>3. Industry Advantages</h4>

This project built capacity for Australian businesses, particularly SMEs
to participate in e-business and link to international supply chains based on
IPv6 next generation Internet technologies.  In particular, it focussed on
enabling rapid adoption of IPv6 based technologies for early-adopter businesses
to ensure maximum interoperability with our major trading partners.  

<br /><br />

IPv6 has the potential to deliver a breakthrough in scale, extensive
interoperability and ease of use of Internet technology, with significant
business advantages, offering improvements over the current generation of
Internet technologies.

<br /><br />

IPv6 will enable key areas of expansion in the number of internet connected
devices, promoting innovation and industry competititveness in the following
areas:
<ul>

<li> Potential to incorporate interoperability between IPv6 enabled networks and
RFID technologies

<li> Potential explosion of Internet-enabled mobile phones requiring address space

<li> Future potential of broadband over power lines with many electrical
appliances online through the power wiring in buildings

<li> Growth of WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) enabled devices

<li> Voice and video over Internet protocol (VoIP)

<li> Capacity to deal with Windows technology capabilities, including Windows
Vista for desktops and Mobile 5.0 platform which gives mobile devices the
ability to run desktop applications as a mobile hand-held PC
</ul>

This project has developed business models and tools for calculating return on
investment of IPv6 deployment.  The project has demonstrated the way in which
these value points will benefit businesses, particularly SMEs, through easier
and more effective B2B value chain transactions.  B2B applications using IPv6
will enable multiple links that support increased efficiencies in business.  

<br /><br />

In the same way that manufacturing approaches to just-in-time manufacture have
benefited from increased linkages over the Internet, we have looked at the
potential to enable multiple business links in a stable and secure Internet
environment.

<br /><br />

The opportunities that IPv6 offers have not yet been taken up by Australian
business, perhaps due to perceived complexity or lack of knowledge of the
benefits. This project has provided the essential understanding and greater
ease of implementation to assist Australian businesses to take advantage
of improved efficiencies based on IPv6.

<br /><br />

<h4>4. Consortium Contributions</h4>

The project consortium has engaged the industry linkages provided
by BuildersNet (BNET) and the Australian Defence Information and Electronic
Systems Association (ADIESA) (part of AEEMA, the Australian Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers Association) with the deep technical and operational
understanding of the Internet Society of Australia (ISOC-AU) and the au Domain
Administration (auDA). The project has actively involved each of the host
organisations, and in turn, their industry associates. 

<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.isoc-au.org.au/">ISOC-AU</a> has been involved in linking to
international developments, providing technical understanding through its
membership, and project oversight and management. ISOC-AU organisational
members cover a broad range of major Internet industry organisations, as well
as many SMEs involved in Internet information, service and provision
industries. 

<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.auda.org.au/">auDA</a> has been involved in developing
specific naming and addressing concepts as well as oversight of the development
of infrastructure support for IPv6 usage and access to a test bed within the
IPv6-ready .au registry.  auDA is the regulatory body for the flourishing
Australian domain name registration industry, and supervises all of the
relevant DNS software and hardware infrastructure.

<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.aigroup.com.au/">AEEMA</a> is the peak industry body
representing Australia's electronics and electrical technology manufacturing
industries, and was involved in financial oversight of the project. Its
forum,  ADIESA has provided 
sponsored workshops for small to medium enterprises involved in the defence
industry and supplier companies. (AEEMA is now part of the
<a href="http://www.aigroup.com.au/" "target=_blank">Australian Industry
Group</a>.)
