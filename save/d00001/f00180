  <p align=justify>The word <cite>awful</cite> actually means
    <i>awe-inspiring</i> or <i>terrifying</i>.  Only the colloquial meaning
    is <i>very bad</i> or <i>poor</i>.  The company name is derived from the

    Tony Blair made it impractical to run a small IT consulting business
    thanks to their IR35 legislation, so the company eventually crumbled
    and died.
