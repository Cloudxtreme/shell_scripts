</div>

<ul>
<li>Write a proper English message, including a salutation, core section and greeting.</li>
<li>Include a descriptive subject and if available your username (typically xxxx-SIXXS or xxxx-RIPE etc).</li>
<li>Use your complete real name in both the message and the from address, thus configure your mail client correctly.</li>
<li>Use the email address you registered with</li>
<li>Explain your problem or question in detail by reading and using the <a href="#problems">Reporting Problems</a> section on this page.</li>
<li>When replying please adhere to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_styles#Inline_replying">Inline Replying &amp; Netiquette Guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>All email, and due to the volumes of spam also the abuse@ address, is spam-scanned and rejected during SMTP-DATA using <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org">SpamAssassin</a> thus don't spam us.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Didn't get a reply? Remember that patience is a virtue.
If you uphold to the above rules then just wait a few days.
At times there is an email backlog on our side, but we will come back to you at one point.
There is also quite a lot happening behind the scenes and we actually also still have real work to do which gets priority.
Resending the message doesn't make the message come through quicker, it will only cause the pile of emails to answer become longer and thus a reply to be delayed further.
Also note that you might receive responses from multiple members of the opers team and that all the oper members read your messages, thus when addressing, address the whole team ('Hi SixXS') and not a individual team member.
</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>
As we strive to make the SixXS service available and useable for everybody, we are always interested in feedback.
Thus if you encounter something which is not clear, too difficult, requires explanation or could be done better
or in a different way which would improve the experience for the users, then do not hesitate to describe the problem 
and email it to our <a href="mailto:info@sixxs.net">contact address</a>.
One can of course also discuss this in the Forum's <a href="/r/makeitbetter">"What can be done better"</a> thread.
</p>

<h2 id="abuse">Abuse</h2>
<p>
Abuse and related messages should be sent directly to
<a href="mailto:abuse@sixxs.net" title="Abuse contact address (abuse@sixxs.net)">abuse@sixxs.net</a>.
SixXS has an Incident Response Team, as registered in the <a href="http://www.ripe.net">RIPE database</a>
with the <a href="/tools/whois/?IRT-SIXXS">IRT-SIXXS</a> handle.
Also see our <a href="/faq/sixxs/?faq=abuse">Abuse FAQ</a> and the above contact information.
In case of reporting SPAM/UCE/Viruses, either attach them in a ZIP file or PGP encrypt your message.
SixXS managed prefixes can be found in whois and in our own <a href="/pops/prefixes/">PoP Prefix List</a>.
IPv4 endpoint information of all tunnels can be found by quering <a href="/tools/whois/">whois.sixxs.net</a> for the IPv6 address.
When including data in the email that might be considered spam/virus, please either password-protect zip it and/or pastebin it
somewhere refering to it in the email. Unfortunately we received too much spam on the abuse address to not restrict this.
</p>

<p>
SixXS uses the RIPE organization object <a href="/tools/whois/?ORG-SIXX1-RIPE">ORG-SIXX1-RIPE</a>
and the role objects <a href="/tools/whois/?SIXT1-RIPE">SIXT1-RIPE</a> for RIPE,
<a href="/tools/whois/?SATR1-AP">SATR1-AP</a> for APNIC
and <a href="/tools/whois/?STRA1-ARIN">STRA1-ARIN</a> for ARIN
which are applied to the various registry objects which are managed by SixXS.
In case of issues with any object associated with that do not hesitate to contact us.
</p>

<h2 id="problems">Reporting problems / Troubleshooting / Checklist</h2>
<p>
When describing a problem, either to the Opers in an email to the above address, or with a post in the <a href="/forum/">Forum</a>
or in the <a href="/tickets/">Ticket System</a>, please provide the following information where available and use it as a checklist to figure out where your problem might be, without it helping you resolv your problem becomes pretty much impossible, but with these details it becomes much easier, thus provide as much information as possible:
</p>
<p>
As stated below, we are not a helpdesk, but we are willing to help; we do need to have these details though, otherwise there is not much help that we can give. When these details are not provided, we will reply and simply point to this list.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Always include clear descriptive information about your problem or inquiry.</li>
<li>When using <a href="/tools/aiccu/">AICCU</a>, please run it using "aiccu test" this should provide minor diagnostics.</li>
<li>When using AICCU, check that you are using the latest version, and of course please specify where the binary comes from, also run it with the 'verbose true' flag and provide the output of that.</li>
<li>Always provide your NIC handle and if applicable the Tunnel or Route IDs you wish to discuss.</li>
<li>Use the email address you have provided in your handle as that is what we use as a contact handle.</li>
<li>Provide details of the setup, type of connections, where NATs are located.</li>
<li>Provide information of your OS type, version and release (ie. uname -a), noting also the distribution name.</li>
<li>Include full interface, routing and firewall tables.</li>
<li>Include the list of firewall and anti-virus software you have installed / are running (note that under Windows some 'firewall' tools don't understand IPv6 at all and thus just throw it away, only uninstall helps for those cases).</li>
<li>Include a IPv4 and IPv6 <acronym title="On Windows one can use 'tracert -4' and 'tracert -6'">traceroute</acronym> to the PoP in question.</li>
<li>With heartbeat tunnels, first check <a href="/faq/connectivity/?faq=heartbeat">clock synchronization</a> or better: use <a href="/tools/aiccu/">AICCU</a>.</li>
<li>Check with <a href="http://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> or <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org">tcpdumps</a> of the interface over which the tunnel runs.<br />
Use -n (numeric) as an option and don't filter returning ICMP which could also come from
routers between your endpoint and the PoP and also use -s 1500 so that one gets the full packet.</li>
<li>The status of the PoP is listed on the <a href="/pops/status/">PoP Status page</a>, if it is marked down there we are aware of the issue and we will try to resolve it as soon as possible. Additionally other issues are listed in the <a href="/tickets/"><img src="/s/ticket-small.gif" alt="Ticket Tracker" />&nbsp;Ticket Tracker</a>.</li>
<li>We are not your personal helpdesk, thus first read the <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> and/or use the <a href="/forum/">forum</a>, many cases can already be solved that way, but we do want to have you actually use the tunnel thus do contact us if the problem persists.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that you should have read the <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> first which we will refer to it directly.
Some questions are also asked and answered in the <a href="/forum/">Forums</a> which is another place you can look first.
We also handle the rule which says stupid questions become stupid answers.
</p>

<h2 id="forum">Forum</h2>
<p>
The <a href="/forum/">SixXS Forums</a> provide a central place for IPv6 users around the world
to communicate with each other. Even though it requires a SixXS login to post it isn't restricted to SixXS users.
The forum is not meant for reporting problems or issues you have with your account or connectivity.
Use the above contact details for those issues.
</p>

<h2 id="irc">IRC Chat Channel</h2>
<p>
To make it possible for users to discuss with other users SixXS and other IPv6 related subjects we suggest
people to use #ipv6 channel on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode">Freenode</a>.
The <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sixxs%2Cipv6&amp;uio=d4">Freenode Webchat</a> allows one to jump right in.
</p>

<div class="note" style="clear: both">
If you need to contact the SixXS Opers, depending on the problem, use the <a href="/tickets/">Ticket system</a> or <a href="#contact">email</a>.<br />
SixXS Opers and Staff are not present on IRC to respond to your questions or comments.
</div>

<p style="clear: left">
We additionally have two status-only channels: #sixxs on both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRCnet">IRCnet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode">Freenode</a>.
Monitoring/status messages are available in this channel: User, tunnel, and subnet review queues,
<a href="/pops/status/">PoP status</a> and other monitoring information is reported on this channel by the SixXS robot.
These channels are moderated (+m) as they are solely status channels, please use the #ipv6 channel on Freenode for any
IPv6 questions as there are a lot of active knowledgeable people present there who can help with an answer to your questions.
</p>

<p style="clear: left">
<a href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a> users might want to use: <code>/ignore #sixxs TOPICS</code> to hide
the individual topic changes which is used to display the current status.
Similar ignore possibilities should be available for your preferred IRC client.
</p>

<p>
Though this channel allows for discussion about IPv6 and SixXS in general,
<i>it is not a contact method towards SixXS Opers/Staff even though they might be present</i>.
