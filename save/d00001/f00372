<b>&gt;Description:</b>
For many months now I have had irregular, random kernel crashes on one of my machines.  The most recent case yielded the following backtrace:

I've recorded 3 of these now, and the backtrace is always through the same series of functions, only the particular pointer values change.


This seems possibly related to kern/43290.  That bug is also caused by a kauth problem in netstat, but it is on kath_cred_getuid where mine is on kauth_cred_uidmatch.


These are happening on a Xen domU (VPS).  Right now it is running NetBSD
6.0_STABLE.  The kernel configuration is derived from the standard XEN3PAE_DOMU with the addition of


no options      INSECURE
options 	PAX_MPROTECT=1 
options		PAX_SEGVGUARD=1
options		PAX_ASLR=1
options         FILEASSOC
options         VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_MD5
options         VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_SHA1
options         VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_RMD160
options         VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_SHA512
options         VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_SHA384
options         VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_SHA256


However, I am pretty certain I got the earliest instances of this crash
earlier on, when it was running 5.1.2 and the stock XEN3PAE_DOMU kernel with no modifications.


The machine in question is primarily a web server, with fairly low traffic.  Things which are typically running all the time are imapproxy, ossec, sshd, php, lighttpd and mysql.  The crash is happening in netstat, but I'm never running it myself at the time of the crashes, so it must be being invoked by something else, most likely one of the above or one of the daily cron scripts.  netstat does not crash if I just run it myself after ssh'ing in, at least not when I pass it no args and it does whatever its defaults are.


I have this machine set to drop to the debugger when it crashes, and I
can access that via my VPS provider's console system, so if anybody
needs me to the next time this happens I can try to provide the values
of variables or anything else which may be necessary.

 Do you happen to have &quot;curtain&quot; on?
 (sysctl security.curtain, security.models.bsd44.curtain,
 security.models.extensions.curtain)

 Yes, I do.  I've got security.curtain=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf.

 The patch below does two things:

 
 First hunk should make the kauth code deal with a missing so_cred (which
 would only happen for new connections not yet accepted), denying their
 visibility to everyone.

 
 Second hunk initializes new sockets credentials earlier during accept(),
 so no sockets with NULL credentials should show up in pcblists.

 
 An alternative to the second part is to move the intialization of credentials
 to newconn().

 Thank you very much!  What source branch should I apply those patches
 against, 6.0_STABLE?

 
 Also, because this is a VPS I can't change the kernel myself directly,
 I need to submit a support ticket and wait for the provider to do it.
 Historically, they've been quite slow to respond to that sort of
 request, so it will probably be a week before I am running with these
 patches (and, of course, it will probably take months after that from me
 to be sure the problem is gone, since it happens so irregularly).  Can
 I assume that in the mean time turning off curtain as a temporary
 workaround should prevent more crashes?

 The patch was against -current, I will commit and request pullup to all
 -6 branches after a bit time for comments from others.

 Yes, it should.

 Ah, I see.  Since it's so slow and painful for me to switch kernels on
 this machine, and I don't want to run current on a system I rely on
 being up, I might just turn of curtain for now and wait until 6.1 comes
 out (which I assume will be soonish since an RC was just announced),
 assuming the fix will have made its way into there.

 
 Thanks very much for your prompt help with this!
