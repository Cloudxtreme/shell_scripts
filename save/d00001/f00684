<A HREF="http://www.aegeanair.com/aegeanen/home/index.asp" target="link">Aegean Air</A> is a new
full service with moderate fares,
airline flying around Greece and elsewhere in Europe with nice new RJ-100s
and tired old 737s.
They're an attractive alternative to Olympic.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.aerlingus.com/" target="link">Aer Lingus</A> has on-line booking with a useful
fare calendar (click the Lowest Fares Availability link below the reservation
box) that shows when cheap fares are available.

</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.aerosvit.ua/eng" target="link">Aerosvit</A> flies to points in Europe, Asia,
and New York from their home base in Kiev, Ukraine.
Fares are often quite cheap, but customer reviews suggest that you
(don't) get what you (don't) pay for.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.africansafariclub.com/html/flights.php" target="link">African Safari Airways</A>
has been in operation since 1967 and fly from UK, Germany,

twenty hubs in Germany to holiday spots all over Europe, as well as

of other info, including the fact that the airline was originally headquartered in
Oregon, USA.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.air-europa.com" target="link">Air Europa</A>, a low-cost airline based in Spain,

in, not surprisingly, Italian.
<A HREF="http://www.alitaliausa.com" target="link">USA site</A> has info and reservations via a lightly
customized version of ITN/Getthere.
They also have online specials, some of which are pretty good.
The Italian government is trying to sell off Alitalia which will probably
cause strikes, since there is no way they can compete with other
European airlines without cutting their huge labor costs.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.aerarann.ie" target="link">Aer Arann</A> flies ATR turboprops within
Ireland and to Scotland, England and the Isle of Man.

blue web site with the usual stuff.
Join their diamond club frequent flyer program if you plan to book,
even if you use a different FF number, since that makes it easier
to trace reservations.
They've been sold to Lufthansa, but in the short term that's not likely
to make much difference since they already codeshare and have somewhat
coordinated schedules.
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.bmibaby.com/" target="link">bmibaby</A> is a low-fare subsidiary of bmi,
with flights from regional airports in England and Wales to

nearby airport on bmi (above.)
</p><p>
<A HREF="http://www.flysn.com" target="link">SN Brussels Airlines</A> is trying very hard
to persuade us that they're not Sabena.
(They arose from the ashes of the Sabena
bankruptcy and seem to have the same cheerfully inept attitude.)
They fly around Europe and to a few places in Africa, but not to North
America.
Flights to the US on their web site are in fact code-shares on American.
