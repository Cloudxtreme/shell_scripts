<h2>Research Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Traffic measurement from ISP backbones</h3>
	<p>
	We are collaborating with several Japanese ISPs to understand
	the traffic behavior of broadband users.
	</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Gulliver project</h3>
	<p>
	The Gulliver Project is a distributed measurement project
	aiming to observe the global behavior of the Internet from
	all over the world, especially from peripheries in the
	Internet topology. The existing measurements are taken
	mostly at places close to the Internet core, and
	measurements from peripheries are very limited. However,
	views from peripheries such as developing regions are
	crucial to understanding the global behavior of the
	Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are many challenges to deploy measurement platforms in
	developing countries due to the lack of human resources and
	infrastructure. A measurement platform needs easy installation
	and remote maintenance, to be robust against instability and
	failures of power and connectivity, and should be secure even
	against physical burglaries. Another important challenge is
	how to remotely manage a large number of platforms.
	</p>
	<p>
	We use a small diskless box as an active measurement
	probe. The probe runs a variant of NetBSD and has remote
	management framework built into the firmware. These probes are
	remotely managed by a set of servers. For example, the probes
	can be instructed to perform measurement and report the result
	to the server or to update its firmware through the GUI on the
	server. 
	</p>

	<a href="http://gulliver.wide.ad.jp/">
	the gulliver project page</a>.
	</p>

</li>
<li><h3>DNS measurement</h3>
	<p>
	This project is an ongoing effort to investigate the root name
	server performance from various locations of the Internet. We
	use simple probe programs to measure the responsetime of the
	root servers. We also measure the response time of the ccTLD
	servers to compare them with the root servers.
	</p>

	More information is available from
	<a href="http://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/dnsprobe/">
	the DNS measurement page</a>.
	</p>
</li>
<li><h3>IPv4/IPv6 comparative path analysis</h3>
	<p>
	One of the major hurdles limiting IPv6 adoption is the
	existence of poorly managed experimental IPv6 sites that
	negatively affect the perceived quality of the IPv6
	Internet. To assist network operators in improving IPv6
	networks, we are exploring methods to identify wide-area IPv6
	network problems. Our approach makes use of parallel IPv4 and
	IPv6 connectivity to dual-stacked nodes. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We identify the existence of an IPv6 path problem by comparing
	IPv6 delay measurements to IPv4 delay measurements. Our test
	results indicate that the majority of IPv6 paths have delay
	characteristics comparable to those of IPv4, although a small
	number of paths exhibit a much larger delay with IPv6. Thus,
	we hope to improve the quality of the IPv6 Internet by
	identifying the worst set of problems. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Our methodology is simple. We create a list of systems with
	IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in actual use by monitoring DNS
	messages. We then measure delay to each address in order to
	select a few systems per site based on their IPv6:IPv4
	response-time ratios. Finally, we run traceroute with Path MTU
	discovery to the selected systems and then visualize the
	results for comparative path analysis.

<li><h3>Publicly available packet traces from the WIDE backbone</h3>
	<p>
	Packet trace data is essential to study network dynamics, usage
	characteristics, and growth patterns, as well as various protocol
	design.
	Despite the increasing demands, it is difficult to obtain packet
	traces, especially at a backbone network.
	Packet traces could contain user privacy information so that they are
	usually available only under non-disclosure agreements.
	</p>
	<p>
	As a chair of the <a href="http://www.wide.ad.jp/wg/mawi">MAWI</a>
	(Measurement and Analysis on the WIDE Internet)
	working group of the <a href="http://www.wide.ad.jp">WIDE Project</a>,
	I have been working on building a public traffic trace repository.
	Our challenges include:
	<ul>
	<li> collecting packet traces from the WIDE backbone network.<br>
	   (sampling method, automation, high-speed packet capturing)
	<li> creating a large set of publicly available traces by removing or
	   scrambling sensitive information. <br>
	   (development of tools and scrambling method)
	<li> development of tools to analyze and visualize packet traces.
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	<a href="http://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/">The WIDE traffic
	data repository</a> contains packet traces from the WIDE backbone.
	</p>

<li><h3>Network data visualization</h3>
	<p>
	Visualization is essential to network traffic analysis.
	We are exploring techniques for visualizing network related
	information.
	</p>
</li>
<li><h3>ALTQ</h3>
	<p>
	Queue management is an essential component in managing network
	traffic.
	A large number of queueing disciplines have been proposed to date in
	order to meet a wide range of requirements.
	However, FIFO queueing is the only queueing discipline used in
	traditional UNIX systems.
	</p>
	<p>
	The ALTQ project is aimed at providing a flexible queueing platform
	in order to promote research and operational experience in the field.
	<a href="../software/index.html#ALTQ">The ALTQ software
	release</a> includes
	a queueing framework and a set of advanced queueing disciplines 
	such as CBQ, HFSC, RED, WFQ BLUE, and RIO.  ALTQ also includes
	traffic conditioning elements for diffserv.
	The ALTQ release for FreeBSD has been publicly available since March
	1997, and used by <a href="altq-rel-projects.html">many groups world 
	wide</a>.  NetBSD and OpenBSD are also supported.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang/HFSC/main.html">H-FSC</a>
	implementation in ALTQ is a joint work with 
	<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang/">Hui Zhang</a> and his
	group members at CMU during my stay at CMU in July 1999.
