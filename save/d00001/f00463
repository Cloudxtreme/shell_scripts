<LI>General FAQ
      <dl>
	  <dt>Q: Are you IPv6 Ready?</dt>
	  <dd>A: We got several IPv6 Ready Logos.  Please refer &quot;<a href="v6ready/index.html">IPv6 Ready?</a>&quot; on our web site for details.</dd>

	  <dt>Q: Something is wrong on my USAGI !!
	  <dd>A: Please report your problem with your situation including
	         the version of the USAGI kit (or patch),
	         series of your kernel (linux26, linux24 or linux22),  
	         version of your glibc and
	         application.
	         If you can attach kernel debug 
	         messages, it is very helpful for us to solve the problem.

	  <dt>Q: What license do USAGI products have ?
	  <dd>A: There're two simple cases.
	    <ol>
	      <li>You can use our original codes under
		<a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/copyright/COPYRIGHT?content-type=text/plain&amp;cvsroot=usagi-misc">BSD-like license</a>.
		Please note that this is similar to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">the modified BSD License, 
		  which is compatible with the GPL</a>;

	    If you have licensing, and any other political issues, please contact 
	    <a href="mailto:usagi-secretary@linux-ipv6.org">usagi-secretary@linux-ipv6.org</a>.

	  <dt>Q: Does USAGI Project develop IPv6 stack separated from original Linux kernels ?
	  <dd>A: We develop in separate cutting-edge repository based on the original Linux kernel.
		 We integrate our efforts to the mainline kernel if each of them becomes ready.

	  <dt>Q: How often do you release snap and stable kit ?
	  <dd>A: We release snapshot kit every two weeks and stable kit several times a year.
      </dl>


<LI>Download FAQ
      <dl>

<LI>Kernel FAQ(General)
      <dl>

	  <dt>Q: I have a problem to use any modules on linux-2.4.x kernel.
	  <dd>A: Upgrade your modutils to 2.4.2 (or later).
	         See <a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/usagi/kernel/linux24/Documentation/Changes?content-type=text/plain">
                 Documentation/Changes</a>.

	  <dt>Q: I have a problem to use any modules on linux-2.6.x kernel.
	  <dd>A: Install module-init-tools version 0.9.9 (or later).
	         See <a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/usagi/kernel/linux26/Documentation/Changes?content-type=text/plain">
                 Documentation/Changes</a>.

	  <dt>Q: Which kernel options should I enable in USAGI kernel ?
	  <dd>A: Please see <a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/usagi/doc/INSTALL.USAGI?content-type=text/plain">
	         INSTALL.USAGI</a> file included in usagi kit.
	         The file explains how to make USAGI kernel and applications.

	  <dt>Q: Where is IPsec for linux-2.4.x?
	  <dd>A: We implemented IPsec for linux-2.4.x kernels.
	  It was, however, removed from our kit to concentrate developments for linux-2.6.x
	  [
	  	usagi-users: 
	  		<a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/ml/usagi-users/msg02517.html">02518</a>,
	  		<a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/ml/usagi-users/msg02518.html">02519</a>,
	  ].
	  Please remember that linux-2.6.x has IPsec.
	  If you really need IPsec for linux-2.4.x in any way, you may want to get
	  absolutely unsupported code from cvs branch tagged with bXFRM_[date].
	  </dd>

	  <dt>Q: Where is Mobile IPv6?
	  <dd>A: (similar to &quot;Where is IPsec for linux-2.4.x?&quot;)
	  We imported and improved Mobile IPv6 for linux-2.4.x kernels.
	  It was, however, removed from our kit to concentrate developments for linux-2.6.x.
	  [
	  	usagi-users: 
	  		<a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/ml/usagi-users/msg02517.html">02518</a>,
	  		<a href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/ml/usagi-users/msg02518.html">02519</a>,
	  ].
	  Please note that USAGI Project and <a href="http://www.mobile-ipv6.org">GO/Core Project</a> 
	  are corraborating for Mobile IPv6 development based on new implementation design.

	  <dt>Q: Which algorithm for source address selection does USAGI IPv6 stack support ?
	  <dd>A: We have supported RFC3484.

	  <dt>Q: How to configure IPv6 with USAGI kernel ?
	  <dd>A: Please read documents under doc directory in USAGI kit. Otherwise
	         <a href="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO.html">Bieringer's page
		 </a>is very useful.

	  <dt>Q: Does USAGI IPv6 support multicast routing ?
	  <dd>A: Currently no. But we have plan to implement multicast routing and routing daemons.

	  <dt class="obsolete">Q: [obsolete] When I configure Linux box as an IPv6 router, it doesn't recognize IPv6 default route. Why ?
	  <dd class="obsolete">A: It is a specification in original Linux kernel. However in USAGI kernel it has improved and
	         an IPv6 default route works as a default route. When you configure Linux as an IPv6 router,
		 we recommend to use USAGI kernel and  enable CONFIG_IPV6_EN_DFLT option.

	  <dt>Q: Are there any differences between compiling IPv6 as a module and build in ?
	  <dd>A: No.

          <dt>Q: How can I configure IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel or 6to4 tunnel on Linux ?
	  <dd>A: Please refer to <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/index.html">Linux IPv6 HOWTO</a>.

<LI>Kernel FAQ(IPsec (Historic))
      <dl>
          <dt>Q: Does USAGI support IPv6 IPsec ?
	  <dd>A: Yes, we support IPsec.

          <dt>Q: Does USAGI kit include IKE daemon ?
	  <dd>A: Yes, we have KAME's racoon and FreeS/WAN's pluto.

	  <dt>Q: What is the difference with FreeS/WAN's code ?
	  <dd>A: We develop separately from FreeS/WAN's.

<LI>Library FAQ
      <dl>
          <dt>Q: Why does USAGI project stop providing patches against glibc ?
	  <dd>A: We make libinet6 library and our applications link it. It is built and
	  	 installed independent from glibc because it is very costly and dangerous to
		 replace glibc.

          <dt>Q: Does USAGI IPv6 stack support RFC2292 or RFC3542 in usagi libinet6?
	  <dd>A: Not yet completed. We are now working.

	  <dt>Q: Why don't you support SO_REUSEPORT socket option ?
	  <dd>A: If we introduce it, we have serious backward compatibility issues.

	  <dt>Q: Does Linux support IPv6 transportations of DNS queries ?
	  <dd>A: It is supported in glibc-2.2 or higher.

	  <dt>Q: How can I get IPv6 addresses using SIOCGIFADDR ioctl ?
	  <dd>A: You can't get IPv6 addresses by SIOCGIFADDR. Instead of SIOCGIFADDR ioctl, you can
	         get IPv6 address using getifaddrs(3) API in USAGI libinet6. The API is derived
		 from BSD/OS.

	  <dt>Q: I failed to configure libinet6; it complains that glibc version is unknown.
	  [from <a href="/ml/usagi-users/msg02056.html">usagi-users 02057</a>]
	  <dd>A: You probably try to use codes which does not support the version of glibc of yours.
	  Stable 4 (or before) or, rather old snapshots does not 
	  support glibc-2.3 series (including pre-2.3 series).
	  Please update your kit to latest.
      </dl>


<LI>Application FAQ
      <dl>
	  <dt>Q: Radvd doesn't work on USAGI kernel.
	  <dd>A: Use the latest version of radvd, later than radvd-0.6.2.

	  <dt>Q: Radvd doesn't work on linux-2.2.X USAGI kernel with message
	         "can't join ipv6-allrouters on eth0".
	  <dd>A: Get latest USAGI patch for linux-2.2.X kernel.

	  <dt>Q: I can't exec ping6 to link-local IPv6 with the message
	         "Invalid argument". Why ?
	  <dd>A: You should specify a scope id with link-local address, for example
	         "ping6 ff02::1%eth0".

	  <dt>Q: I can't exec ping6 to IPv4-mapped address. Why ?
	  <dd>A: It is a specification. We don't allow bind IPv4 mapped address with raw IPv6 sockets.

	  <dt>Q: Does USAGI Project have DHCPv6 implementations ?
	  <dd>A: Currently no. The URL may help you, <a href="http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net/">http://dhcpv6.sourceforge.net/</a>.
